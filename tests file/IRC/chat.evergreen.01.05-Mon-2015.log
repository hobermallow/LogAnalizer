2015-01-05T11:22:22  <dbs> Speaking of network problems, trying to fix up our SIP server. Boy, lots of changes since 2.4-ish days :)
2015-01-05T11:22:27  <dbs> community++
2015-01-05T11:26:06  *** ericar_ has joined #evergreen
2015-01-05T11:28:53  *** ericar has quit IRC
2015-01-05T11:28:59  *** ericar_ is now known as ericar
2015-01-05T11:36:14  <dbs> Now to figure out why our self-check logs into SIP successfully, renew or checkout items, and then once the session is done, start reporting network failure.
2015-01-05T11:36:40  <dbs> (and then it automatically logs back in again after a while)
2015-01-05T11:37:03  <dbs> Only SIPServer has changed, but I guess in a way that no longer works with our previous self-check config. Hrm.
2015-01-05T11:44:25  <Bmagic> dbs: that sounds familiar
2015-01-05T11:45:47  <Bmagic> dbs: we found an issue with timeouts on a self check software called circIT, when querying a patron with a ton of holds it would take more than 12 seconds, and circIT would close the session
2015-01-05T11:46:30  <Bmagic> I know it's not exactly the issue you described but keep that in mind
2015-01-05T11:47:10  <Bmagic> The AFOK message was removed in the newer versions of SIPserver which tricked some of our self check machines as well
2015-01-05T11:54:11  <dbs> Bmagic: cool, thanks for the heads up
2015-01-05T11:54:32  <Dyrcona> <sarcasm>Standards.</sarcasm>
2015-01-05T11:56:27  <dbs> Or something to do with the new Multiplex worker-keepalive stuff? http://git.evergreen-ils.org/?p=SIPServer.git;a=commitdiff;h=7e4fbac12f6018b4d5a36d7a4360789ced929aa0
2015-01-05T11:58:48  <dbs> Or allow_sc_status_then_login parameter?
2015-01-05T11:58:48  <dbs> man.
2015-01-05T11:59:22  <eeevil> dbs: what's the selfcheck vendor?
2015-01-05T11:59:39  <dbs> eeevil: 3M
2015-01-05T12:00:00  <dbs> I'm also trying to untangle the changes to SIPConfig.xml vs. oils_sip.xml.example; bits missing from each
2015-01-05T12:00:56  <eeevil> I haven't seen 3M require status_then_login before. IIRC, that's an envisionware and bibliotecha issue, primarily
2015-01-05T12:01:52  <dbs> Seeing as I have "sending SC status without logging in first" in my syslogs, I think our 3M unit is requiring that too
2015-01-05T12:01:55  <bshum> dbs: Yeah I thought I filed a bug to work on that for 2.8, but I can't seem to find it now.
2015-01-05T12:02:24  <dbs> Methinks perhaps the default should be "enabled", heh
2015-01-05T12:02:25  <eeevil> dbs: ha, indeed :)
2015-01-05T12:02:57  <eeevil> indeed to "you need it" ... unsure (though don't feel strongly about) making that the default
2015-01-05T12:04:02  <eeevil> thinking a little more, I know many sites need it on, so, I'd be fine with enabling by default, actually.

2015-01-05T16:34:58  <bshum> dbwells: For the LDAP authenticator, can it be assumed that the "org_units" section allows for the possibility that you could have different authenticators for different ou's?
2015-01-05T16:35:28  <dbwells> bshum: Yes, that's the idea
2015-01-05T16:35:39  <bshum> Gotcha.
2015-01-05T16:36:40  <bshum> I was just asked recently whether we could support LDAP authentication for schools that share a system but not the same authentications.
2015-01-05T16:36:42  <bshum> So that helps.
2015-01-05T16:36:43  <bshum> Thanks!
2015-01-05T16:37:04  <dbwells> Feel free to ask me for help if it doesn't work as expected.  I am not sure if anyone has used that feature in a live instance.
2015-01-05T16:38:04  <bshum> dbwells: Sounds good.  I'm not sure when/if we'll try it out.
