2015-01-06T09:12:08  <Dyrcona> Cause it is very frustrating to try writing a query in the SQL window while server status updates in the background.

2015-01-06T13:51:02  <csharp> so... is there a plan in the works to move opensrf 2.4 alpha to an actual release?
2015-01-06T13:51:34  <csharp> feels kinda wrong moving to an alpha in production
2015-01-06T13:51:43  <bshum> Eh, it's just a label.
2015-01-06T13:51:44  * csharp is willing to assist
2015-01-06T13:51:51  <bshum> Go with opensrf master, join us!
2015-01-06T13:51:53  <bshum> :D
2015-01-06T13:53:25  <bshum> I'd be curious how much of http://wiki.evergreen-ils.org/doku.php?id=dev:release_process:opensrf:2.0 still applies
2015-01-06T13:53:29  <csharp> so is it the websockets stuff that keeps it in alpha status?
2015-01-06T13:53:58  <bshum> At the last dev meeting, gmcharlt took an action item to cut 2.4.0 official, but I assume he was sidetracked with moving / holidays.
2015-01-06T13:54:18  <bshum> OpenSRF master hasn't moved since August, other than mainly doc updates
2015-01-06T13:54:28  <bshum> So pretty much, it's as ready as it's going to be.
2015-01-06T13:54:40  <bshum> Dyrcona and I are running the stuff since August in production anyways.
2015-01-06T13:55:07  <bshum> Though admittedly I am not actively using the websockets stuff since we're still figuring out what bits we're going to deploy and how for our web staff client.
2015-01-06T13:55:27  *** rjackson-isl has quit IRC
2015-01-06T13:55:30  <csharp> yeah, we're not going to use websockets (in production anyway)
2015-01-06T13:56:09  <bshum> So, like I said, a label :)
2015-01-06T13:56:28  <bshum> But now I'm curious to see if I can build a tarball anyways
2015-01-06T13:56:40  <csharp> well, I would understand the "it's just a label" idea if it wasn't labled alpha :-)
2015-01-06T13:56:56  <csharp> "alpha" means "pre-release, test at your own risk"
2015-01-06T13:59:28  <jeff> pay no attention to that sign that says "EXTREMELY DANGEROUS"
2015-01-06T13:59:38  <jeff> </obSidReference>
2015-01-06T14:00:06  *** nhilton has joined #evergreen
2015-01-06T14:00:31  <bshum> Eh, alpha to me just means first cut at this date and time :)
2015-01-06T14:00:35  <bshum> But I get what you're saying csharp
2015-01-06T14:01:06  <bshum> From a cursory glance, I think those wiki steps I linked above ought to work actually.
2015-01-06T14:01:12  <csharp> well, I think we should agree on the definitions of alpha, beta, RC, and release, even if we're going to get existential and say that they're all the same
2015-01-06T14:02:53  *** nhilton_ has quit IRC
2015-01-06T14:06:49  <bshum> Hmm
2015-01-06T14:06:54  <bshum> I've never tagged anything before.
2015-01-06T14:07:02  * bshum goes to read more about this
2015-01-06T14:09:39  <dbs> bshum: we're running opensrf master too (minus the one commit that broke script-based circulation)
2015-01-06T14:09:44  <bshum> csharp: fwiw, the only difference between 2.4.0-alpha and master seems to be the additional commits I added for websockets documentation and some changes to the apache files.
2015-01-06T14:09:52  <dbs> tagging is easy enogh
2015-01-06T14:09:53  <dbs> enough
2015-01-06T14:10:19  <bshum> So essentially, if you've tested alpha and it's not broken, then good odds that'll be the only thing we see for 2.4.0 real
2015-01-06T14:10:40  <bshum> Unless there's more stuff waiting to get pulled in for OpenSRF.
2015-01-06T14:10:47  <bshum> Which I haven't looked at lately actually.
2015-01-06T14:11:00  <dbs> http://evergreen-ils.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=dev:release_process:opensrf:2.0 includes the git tag command

2015-01-06T14:15:12  <bshum> Fwiw, https://launchpad.net/opensrf/+milestone/2.4.0 notes the stuff targeting 2.4.0
2015-01-06T14:15:37  <bshum> Of those, the only one I'd be ready to sign today would be berick's fix for jessie/trusty mpm_event
2015-01-06T14:15:49  <bshum> But that's documented in the Evergreen 2.7 README too
2015-01-06T14:16:00  <bshum> It's nice to have it automated though
2015-01-06T14:16:10  <bshum> And then we could drop that from the extra steps

2015-01-06T14:51:28  <jboyer-isl> Is there a short description of why it's better to use "real" tags vs. the tags/rel_x_y(_z) branches that we do? My understanding is that a tag is static (points to a single commit, forever) while the tags/rel_ branches can have bugfixes added later.
2015-01-06T14:51:36  *** akilsdonk has quit IRC
2015-01-06T14:51:58  <jboyer-isl> Though I'll admit that my understanding may be mis-understood.
2015-01-06T14:52:12  <berick> jboyer-isl: bug fixes are merged into the parent branch
2015-01-06T14:52:21  <berick> rel_x_y
2015-01-06T14:52:24  <berick> not the release branch
2015-01-06T14:52:56  <jboyer-isl> I see.
2015-01-06T14:52:58  <berick> so, there's no benefit to being able to merge stuff into the release branch and it could, in fact, cause confusion
2015-01-06T14:53:28  <bshum> Well, making the tarball doesn't seem so bad.
2015-01-06T14:53:35  * bshum keeps slowly hammering away
2015-01-06T14:53:49  <jboyer-isl> So we treat those branches like tags, but only in so far as everyone just leaves them alone?

2015-01-06T17:08:42  <csharp> wheee!
2015-01-06T17:08:58  <csharp> all calm now, though ;-)

2015-01-06T17:16:47  <phasefx> that Archive::Zip failure also impacts the Excel Writer module that the reporting system uses
2015-01-06T17:17:23  <bshum> phasefx: What debian are we using for that server?
2015-01-06T17:17:28  <phasefx> wheezy
2015-01-06T17:20:31  <phasefx> there is a libarchive-zip-perl package we could pull in
2015-01-06T17:20:52  <phasefx> I'll try reproducing the error and then see if installing that package helps
2015-01-06T17:21:36  <phasefx> there's also libexcel-writer-xlsx-perl
2015-01-06T17:21:52  <phasefx> that sounds even better
2015-01-06T17:22:12  <eeevil> phasefx: I thought we'd moved to that package, actually, to get around the 64k limit... I might be misremembering, though

2015-01-06T17:22:37  <pinesol_green> [evergreen|Mike Rylander] LP#1351355: Switch to XLSX format for Excel report output - <http://git.evergreen-ils.org/?p=Evergreen.git;a=commit;h=e19d29a>
2015-01-06T17:22:44  <bshum> I know we changed to using the packaged deb for Ubuntu, but thought eeevil wanted to keep Debian with the CPAN version because of Squeeze issues?
2015-01-06T17:22:49  <bshum> But you're saying Wheezy, so :)
2015-01-06T17:23:59  <eeevil> bshum: I don't recall the details now, but could look again.  squeeze is now EOL'd, I think?
2015-01-06T17:24:03  <bshum> Ah maybe only for Ubuntu 14.04.  Doesn't look like Precise was updated to use a package either.
2015-01-06T17:25:19  <phasefx> cpan has version .81, and wheezy package is .47
2015-01-06T17:26:38  * bshum refers back to: http://irc.evergreen-ils.org/evergreen/2014-08-04#i_115000
2015-01-06T17:26:47  <bshum> Where we last talked about packaged vs. CPAN
2015-01-06T17:27:08  <bshum> But yeah, the packaged version is a bit dated
2015-01-06T17:30:19  <eeevil> yeah ... I'd fear 0.47, I think ... there was something specific we use that older versions lacked
2015-01-06T17:33:11  <eeevil> well, it looks like it /should/ work ... anyone have tuits for testing that?
2015-01-06T17:34:20  <eeevil> did precise even have the module? squeeze does not
