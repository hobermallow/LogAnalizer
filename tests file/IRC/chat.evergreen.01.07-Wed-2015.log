2015-01-07T11:07:07  <Bmagic> Is there a switch somewhere to make the action triggers that send emails to change the email headers to flag the content as HTML instead of plain/text ?
2015-01-07T11:08:30  <eeevil> Bmagic: the templates that send email control the headers, IIRC, so you can just set the mime type I'd think
2015-01-07T11:08:45  <Bmagic> I was wondering about that

2015-01-07T11:12:52  <jeff> huh. the "maintenance required" indicator on that METAR report hasn't been on for as long as I assumed -- just kicked in this morning.
2015-01-07T11:15:03  <berick> bshum: time permitting, i may create a page like this for EG release cutting.. I just want to be sure you didn't already do that and I missed it.  http://wiki.evergreen-ils.org/doku.php?id=dev:release_process:opensrf:2.0
2015-01-07T11:18:46  <bshum> berick: Sounds good, we should probably delete this old page for Evergreen 2.0 (subversion steps)

2015-01-07T11:19:14  <bshum> I added some minor notes to it based on my own dealings
2015-01-07T11:19:25  <bshum> Maybe we can use that as a baseline to create a new page.

2015-01-07T11:21:41  <bshum> berick: Most of my notes were for pre-req stuff

2015-01-07T11:26:36  <berick> thinking back to the dev/packager makefile stuff
2015-01-07T11:26:51  <bshum> berick: It wasn't too much extra stuff.  I can probably get you a list momentarily of specific packages.
2015-01-07T11:27:06  <berick> that would be great.  no rush, though
2015-01-07T11:33:19  <bshum> berick: Yeah it's not a long list
2015-01-07T11:33:34  <bshum> make, automake, autoconf, libtool (just to be sure the basics are done)
2015-01-07T11:34:32  <bshum> libtemplate-perl liblocale-maketext-lexicon-perl
2015-01-07T11:34:59  <bshum> That's it.
2015-01-07T11:35:08  <bshum> Everything else is covered.
2015-01-07T11:35:27  <berick> great, thanks
2015-01-07T11:35:32  <berick> i'll add those to the LP branch
2015-01-07T11:35:45  <bshum> Oh, I guess except for source-highlight asciidoc :)
2015-01-07T11:35:52  <bshum> But that's for documentors
2015-01-07T11:36:16  <berick> hmm
2015-01-07T11:36:35  <berick> that's a good question.  i usually generate asciidoc output on the same machine I build releases on
2015-01-07T11:36:40  <berick> and it it part of the process
2015-01-07T11:36:44  <bshum> Right.
2015-01-07T11:37:14  <bshum> Not hyper critical, just naming extras
2015-01-07T11:37:18  <berick> so, we'd also need asciidoc (and source-highlight)
2015-01-07T11:39:03  <bshum> We talked about calling the developer target if we select packager right?
2015-01-07T11:39:15  <bshum> Since we need the developer pre-req's to build the web client properly
2015-01-07T11:39:45  <berick> yes, i'll add that too

2015-01-07T11:42:53  <dbwells> A few parts could be easily scripted, but I haven't gotten lazy enough yet.
2015-01-07T11:45:17  <berick> dbwells: this list of which you speak...

2015-01-07T11:45:34  <berick> together we'll triangulate the real process
2015-01-07T11:45:42  <Dyrcona> I have. I've scripted the whole thing.
2015-01-07T11:46:08  <Dyrcona> Though I have a few manual steps in the middle of the process.
2015-01-07T11:46:33  <dbwells> berick: sure, I'll paste it up somewhere.

2015-01-07T12:04:03  <dbwells> berick: Yeah, I mentioned that in the notes at the bottom of the paste.  I think so.  I am not 100% confident that the ... range is better, but it seemed to give a better changelog for me in certain cases.
2015-01-07T12:04:40  <dbwells> The HEAD url thing is just broken the way it is, so that part I am more confident in.

2015-01-07T12:08:38  <bshum> dbwells: berick: Hmm, I haven't added that commit prior to any of my builds for 2.7 series.  But I agree with the general direction :)
2015-01-07T12:09:12  <dbwells> bshum: It's a very small deal :)
2015-01-07T12:11:18  <dbwells> berick: It's pretty dense, but I think this helped me understand it:  http://git.661346.n2.nabble.com/Question-about-right-only-td6763571.html
2015-01-07T12:12:31  <dbwells> Basically, I think 'right-only' only works with the '...' range selector, so it helped filter out bug fixes which had gotten into, for example, both 2.5.x and 2.6.0.
2015-01-07T12:15:01  <dbwells> To quote the page "For example, --cherry-pick --right-only A...B omits those commits from B which are in A or are patch-equivalent to a commit in A."
2015-01-07T12:18:43  <dbwells> The "patch-equivalent" part is what we are after.  Otherwise, ".." does the same thing for us.
2015-01-07T12:19:09  <berick> dbwells: in the specific case of a bug committed to both 2.5.x and 2.6.0, i'm curious why we wouldn't want it represented in the 2.5.x release notes.
2015-01-07T12:19:16  <berick> or am I misunderstanding?
2015-01-07T12:20:37  <dbwells> No, this keeps it from reappearing in the 2.6.0 changelog, not the other way.
2015-01-07T12:21:01  *** jihpringle has joined #evergreen
2015-01-07T12:21:05  <berick> oh, ok, i am misunderstanding.  thanks.
2015-01-07T12:22:28  <dbwells> With ".." we see every commit since the common ancestor.  With "--cherry-pick --right-only A...B", we see every commit since the common ancestor, minus those which have an equivalent commit on "the other side".  That's my understanding, at least :)
2015-01-07T12:23:25  <dbwells> Plus, I think the "--cherry-pick --right-only" options we have in there do nothing with the ".." operator, so something has to give.
2015-01-07T12:24:37  * berick escorts 2 git commands into the thunderdome
2015-01-07T12:34:03  <dbwells> I think it only matters when crossing a major version, as that's the only time the common ancestor won't be linear with the possible changes.
2015-01-07T12:36:56  <dbwells> berick: You're probably trying the same thing, but I just tested a changelog from rel_2_5_5...rel_2_6_0 vs rel_2_5_5..rel_2_6_0, and the "..." successfully excluded 950dede414 / 6ec8bcea7e as being equivalent (and thus not a real change).

2015-01-07T14:00:31  <kmlussier> Dyrcona: Cake pans? That sounds fun!
2015-01-07T14:01:02  <Dyrcona> Yep. Moses Greeley Parker Memorial Library in Dracut.
2015-01-07T14:02:53  <kmlussier> Dyrcona: Hmmm...this is a case where the custom code NOBLE uses to incorporate digital images in their records might come in handy at MVLC.
2015-01-07T14:03:07  <kmlussier> Because it would be nice to see what the cake pan looks like before making a trip to the library to check it out.
2015-01-07T14:03:40  <Dyrcona> Yes, we thought of that.
2015-01-07T14:03:54  <Dyrcona> They don't allow requests, IIRC.
2015-01-07T14:04:35  <kmlussier> Also, they have a lot of pans on one bib record. It probably wouldn't work well in that case.
2015-01-07T14:05:55  <dbs> Oh, that's a cataloguing anti-pattern
2015-01-07T14:06:47  <dbs> Can't define the proper extents (9" x 9" x 2") if you don't have one record per different cake pan dimensions, etc.
2015-01-07T14:08:36  <collum> We had pans at one time, but they were also on a single bib.
2015-01-07T14:08:50  <collum> I wonder how you would measure that Mickey Mouse shaped pan.
2015-01-07T14:09:01  <Dyrcona> Yep.
2015-01-07T14:09:04  <jeff> by volume? :-)
2015-01-07T14:10:00  <Dyrcona> Ideally, you'd want a different bib record for each shape.
2015-01-07T14:13:45  <RoganH> Under physical description you could define it as irregular shape.  Hmmm.... if you measured enough points of reference you could define the shape.  Where to put that.....
2015-01-07T14:15:37  <Dyrcona> RoganH++ for mentioning tools
2015-01-07T14:15:54  <RoganH> I'd say you could define dimensions in the 300 even of an irregular shape.
2015-01-07T14:18:54  <Dyrcona> I suppose my answer could have been more helpful such as offering information about how they're cataloged and offering to put them in touch with someone at the library.
2015-01-07T14:21:00  <Dyrcona> I guess you'd catalog a sewing pattern as an artifact.
2015-01-07T14:21:08  <RoganH> I assume at this point that everything that happens by email is a hallucination and they should go on a vision quest to find the right person.  Maybe their spirit animal will help them.
2015-01-07T14:21:16  <Dyrcona> heh.
2015-01-07T14:21:20  <RoganH> (Yes, it has been one of those weeks.)

2015-01-07T16:09:06  <jwoodard> Hello good peoples. Is it possible to get a list of patrons with duplicate accounts in at multiple libraries through the reports interface.
2015-01-07T16:10:09  <jwoodard> What I want to know is if patrons at our libraries have accounts at other consortium libraries if that makes any sense.
2015-01-07T16:11:14  <bshum> So... probably a list based on factors like similar names?  (assuming that you can't re-use barcodes for being unique)
2015-01-07T16:11:29  * bshum doesn't know offhand of how to do something like that via the reports module.
2015-01-07T16:12:57  <jeff> bshum: it's all just matchpoints. :-)
2015-01-07T16:13:16  <bshum> jeff: True enough.
2015-01-07T16:13:20  <jeff> first_given_name + family_name + dob + zip code, etc.
2015-01-07T16:13:25  *** RoganH has quit IRC
2015-01-07T16:13:42  <jeff> it seems likely that you're going to run into problems of accuracy.
2015-01-07T16:14:20  <Dyrcona> I've done things like that recently, but not in reports.
2015-01-07T16:14:23  <Dyrcona> It's not easy.
2015-01-07T16:15:33  <jeff> i wouldn't recommend using reports. it would be possible to get a report saying that X patrons have exactly this name and exactly this phone number, or exactly this name and address, but you're going to have very little room for fuzziness or other tweaking.
2015-01-07T16:16:47  <jeff> Other than at registration time, is detection of duplicate patrons something that would be a feature many would desire?
2015-01-07T16:17:28  <jeff> If you've access and feel comfortable with SQL, I'd start there.
2015-01-07T16:19:15  *** collum has quit IRC
2015-01-07T16:25:59  <jwoodard> Thanks for the ideas. I know a feature to detect duplicate patrons would be received well in our consortium.
2015-01-07T16:27:53  <jwoodard> I didn't think it was possible through the reports module but though I would ask.
2015-01-07T16:27:53  <jeff> jwoodard: how would you see yourself using such a feature?
2015-01-07T16:29:28  *** rjackson-isl has quit IRC
2015-01-07T16:29:48  <jwoodard> Recenlty we had a very larger library join our consortium. When they join many of their patrons had library cards with several of our consortium libraries that were nearby.
2015-01-07T16:30:58  <jwoodard> We would use it to identify patrons with duplicate accounts and merge those accounts.
2015-01-07T16:31:40  *** jboyer-isl has quit IRC
2015-01-07T16:32:27  <jwoodard> Also to prevent patrons from running up fines at one library and getting another card and doing the same but at a different library.(a issue we have ran into a few times)
2015-01-07T16:32:36  * jeff nods
2015-01-07T16:33:07  <jeff> there is built-in functionality that attempts to alert staff when they find a patron with the same address/etc.
2015-01-07T16:33:27  <jeff> that doesn't help in the case you described where a migration took place and resulted in duplicate patrons.
2015-01-07T16:34:35  <jwoodard> That and I'm OCD about things like this. Duplicate records are the enemy to my sanity.
2015-01-07T16:35:18  <jeff> "incorrectly merged" records are also a bit of a pain.
2015-01-07T16:35:28  <jeff> sometimes "this is obviously a duplicate"... isn't.
2015-01-07T16:36:31  <jeff> so, given a report of "duplicate" patrons -- would you flag them so that the patron would need to clarify if they were duplicate or not, or would you merge first, ask questions later?
2015-01-07T16:36:39  <jeff> (that second option scares me a bit)
2015-01-07T16:37:08  *** nhilton_ has joined #evergreen
2015-01-07T16:38:30  <jwoodard> We are developing policies to handled that now. The way it would be handled is that the home library would be contacted and they would handled as our policy dictates.
2015-01-07T16:38:36  <jeff> in a given set of patrons seen as duplicate to each other, you could mark all but the oldest (or "nearest", whatever) accould as inactive and flag it with an alert message -- or just put an alerting note on all of them, or...

2015-01-07T16:39:43  *** nhilton has quit IRC
2015-01-07T16:40:26  <jwoodard> In that scenario one library would handle contacting the patron and from there the decision to merge or not would be made.
