2015-01-09T10:36:52  <csharp> kmlussier: yes, beginning next weekend
2015-01-09T10:37:13  <csharp> slony is such a PITA, I'm happy to see a straightforward setup
2015-01-09T10:37:30  <csharp> *and* there's automatic failover, which is not possible with slony
2015-01-09T10:38:02  <csharp> still learning, but it's nice to start the day with a success ;-)
2015-01-09T10:38:15  <bshum> It was always my understanding that Slony's big deal was that it allowed you to pick and choose which bits to replicate?
2015-01-09T10:38:29  <bshum> vs. innate replication which seems to just do the whole thing
2015-01-09T10:38:32  <csharp> yes, that's the *remaining* advantage of slony
2015-01-09T10:38:55  <csharp> that mattered before we had three identical servers with lots of disk space

2015-01-09T10:40:00  <kmlussier> bshum: I'm happy to see you're following up on my advice from earlier. :)
2015-01-09T10:40:05  <eeevil> csharp: that, and the fact that long-running queries with either be killed or stall replication (and risk filling disk with WAL)
2015-01-09T10:40:09  <bshum> berick: For translation sync right?
2015-01-09T10:40:25  <eeevil> where "that" is "the remaining advantage of slony"
2015-01-09T10:40:53  <berick> bshum: yah
2015-01-09T10:42:36  <csharp> eeevil: oh - good to know

2015-01-09T10:44:28  <csharp> eeevil: on the ESI-administered locations, are you using slony or built-in?
2015-01-09T10:44:59  <eeevil> csharp: killing queries? any long running report is at risk
2015-01-09T10:45:12  <eeevil> and, both, for different purposes
2015-01-09T10:45:13  <csharp> oh - hmm
2015-01-09T10:45:41  <eeevil> there are good reasons (and use cases) for both
2015-01-09T10:45:42  <csharp> we regularly have reports that run 2+ hours, even on the new hardwar
2015-01-09T10:45:43  <csharp> e
2015-01-09T10:46:14  <eeevil> the timeout is configurable, and probably infinite by default
2015-01-09T10:46:42  <eeevil> but a long running query also keeps the master from doing some cleanup
2015-01-09T10:47:13  <eeevil> or did, at least ... not sure if that is fixed in a release yet or now
2015-01-09T10:47:48  <dbs> pretty sure those early issues were fixed relatively early too
2015-01-09T10:47:50  * csharp is doing more rtfm work
2015-01-09T10:48:54  <eeevil> dbs: I hope so :)
2015-01-09T10:49:47  <eeevil> there were a spate of bad replication-related data-loss bugs, IIRC, about 9-12 months ago, too ... those were scarier, but fixed relatively rapidly

2015-01-09T11:01:50  <csharp> jboyer-isl: 9.3
2015-01-09T11:02:28  <csharp> reading up on cascading replication (asynchronous only) vs. synchronous replication
2015-01-09T11:04:07  <jboyer-isl> That's probably for the best. We're on 9.1 and after having one of our 2 replicants fall off the end for a second time I'm going back to Slony until at least 9.3 or 9.4. :/ (in 9.1 you had to guess how many WAL segments your replicants might lag; I think in 9.3 or .4 the master won't through away files that slaves still need)
2015-01-09T11:04:28  <berick> bshum: dbwells: FYI started on http://wiki.evergreen-ils.org/doku.php?id=dev:release_process:evergreen:2.8

2015-01-09T11:06:12  <bshum> berick++ # sweet
2015-01-09T11:06:30  <jboyer-isl> There is a lot of traffic along the link that this replicant was using, but even with 6000+ WAL segments being kept it didn't make it 2 weeks. Identical hardware that sits on the same switch is still keeping up with a much faster master.
2015-01-09T11:06:30  * berick is done editing for now
2015-01-09T11:09:09  <csharp> jboyer-isl: interesting
2015-01-09T11:09:29  <dbs> csharp: yes, we were when we were hosted by UoGuelph, for years. always asynchronous, and primarily for disaster recovery and offline reads.
2015-01-09T11:09:42  <dbs> You really don't want to do synchronous.
2015-01-09T11:09:58  <csharp> dbs: ok - good to know
2015-01-09T11:10:11  <csharp> our ideal setup would be cascading
2015-01-09T11:10:16  <csharp> 1 to 2 to 3
2015-01-09T11:10:23  * dbs likes marc 024 for URIs
2015-01-09T11:11:42  <jboyer-isl> csharp, I didn't think you could do that. If there's a recovery.conf in place I didn't think the server would start any wal_senders. Is that something new in 9.2 or .3?
2015-01-09T11:12:04  <dbs> hey berick, here's a fun old one: python oils.utils is hardcoded to speak http, so you can't talk to an https-only server
2015-01-09T11:12:20  <dbs> 9.2 IIRC is where cascading started to be introduced
2015-01-09T11:12:52  <jboyer-isl> Ah, I see. Never mind then, I'm just living in the past.

2015-01-09T11:46:39  <mrpeters> we have only had 2 snows, and this is the first bitter cold
2015-01-09T11:47:19  <mrpeters> this time last year we were close to breaking snowfall records, so im not complaining too much
2015-01-09T11:48:19  <Dyrcona> mrpeters: similar here.
2015-01-09T11:48:53  <Dyrcona> though maybe not record snow fall last year, but we had over a week of bitter cold right around new year last year.

2015-01-09T12:26:17  <jboyer-isl> I suppose that would have been too easy. :/
2015-01-09T12:27:51  <Dyrcona> Most of syslog are messages from postfix that ought to just be in mail.log, but I'm not gonna fix that right now.
2015-01-09T12:34:34  <Dyrcona> Weird: at 11:35:26 I have ejabberd accepted a connection.
2015-01-09T12:38:18  <Dyrcona> After that all ejabberd log messages are the emfile error.
2015-01-09T12:38:40  <Dyrcona> Despite ejabberd not accepting new connections things seem to be working for now.

2015-01-09T12:47:02  *** juneo has quit IRC
2015-01-09T12:48:58  <Dyrcona> The typical answer of increasing ulimit can't be correct, since ulimit -n for ejabberd is 65535 and ejabberd only has 624 files open.
2015-01-09T12:50:05  <Dyrcona> Looks like we changed it across the board, not just on a user by user basis.

2015-01-09T13:28:53  <eeevil> Dyrcona: is pam respecting configured limits for both login and su? the latter is needed when startup scripts su to the ejabberd user, I believe (see: http://metajack.im/2008/09/23/file-descriptors-are-yummy-or-common-pitfalls-of-ejabberd/ )
2015-01-09T13:31:28  <Dyrcona> eeevil: Thanks. I skipped that one, because I saw something about ERL_MAX_PORTS.
2015-01-09T13:32:15  <Dyrcona> eeevil: After looking at pam, login does respect limits, but su doesn't, and that could be our problem since the startup script does su when starting ejabberd.
2015-01-09T13:32:21  <Dyrcona> eeevil++
2015-01-09T13:32:54  <Dyrcona> I used to like pam, but now I don't. :)
2015-01-09T13:33:22  <eeevil> heh
2015-01-09T13:39:32  <Dyrcona> What I'm not finding is what happens if the limits for all uses is set to 65535 and the line is commented out in su. Will pam use some built-in limit?
2015-01-09T13:42:24  <jeff> even if i thought i knew the answer, i'd test by doing something like echoing the output of uname -a into a file from within an init script that uses su
2015-01-09T13:42:39  <jeff> (from a command run with su from an init script, that is)
2015-01-09T13:48:20  <Dyrcona> Here's a little something from the Debian wiki: Note that pam_limits is not used in /etc/pam.d/common-session and /etc/pam.d/common-session-noninteractive, so it won't be active for daemons
2015-01-09T13:51:33  <Dyrcona> Dunno if that applies here for certain, since the init script does use su.
2015-01-09T13:51:50  <Dyrcona> Dunno if setting in either of those files would do anything.
2015-01-09T13:54:55  * dbs wonders if we have a version of reporter.super_simple_record with non-normalized author / title / etc yet
2015-01-09T13:55:24  * Dyrcona doesn't.
2015-01-09T13:56:14  * dbs should probably just create a view based on a MODS-ified version of a record for adhoc query/report purposes
2015-01-09T13:56:19  <csharp> dbs: we don't, that I know of.  our libraries want that, though
2015-01-09T13:56:32  <csharp> it would be very welcome
2015-01-09T13:56:35  * dbs hatesesss the normalization :)
2015-01-09T13:56:48  <dbs> (I understand why it's there, but yeah, need an alternative)
2015-01-09T13:57:01  <berick> *cough* metabib display fields
2015-01-09T13:57:01  <dbs> okay. will see what I can put together for the humans
2015-01-09T13:57:07  <csharp> it's been a pet peeve - nothing to rise to the top of anyone's wish list
2015-01-09T13:57:11  <dbs> yet
2015-01-09T13:57:12  <dbs> yeah
2015-01-09T13:58:34  <Dyrcona> Now, after having all this conversation about pam and limits, I swear that I did see ejabberd have more than 1024 files open earlier today.
2015-01-09T13:58:47  <Dyrcona> However, using tmux, I don't have any console scroll back.
2015-01-09T14:00:25  <kmlussier> dbs: We would love to see non-normalized fields.
2015-01-09T14:01:30  *** finnx has joined #evergreen
2015-01-09T14:02:11  <kmlussier> It's why I was so excited for display fields, but I guess that's not ready yet.
2015-01-09T14:06:08  <Dyrcona> su doesn't appear to be the problem.
2015-01-09T14:06:34  <Dyrcona> Without or without pam_limits.so enabled, I get the right limit with just su.
2015-01-09T14:13:57  <bshum> Does anyone use clark-kent.pl with concurrency other than 1?  I'm trying to remember how to have clark handle multiple report running at once, but it's been too many years since I last tried it out.
2015-01-09T14:16:24  <berick> bshum: pretty sure changing the concurrency value is all you have to do
2015-01-09T14:20:26  <bshum> Okay, so something like... "clark-kent.pl --concurrency=3 --daemon" should keep around up to 3 reports at once
2015-01-09T14:20:34  * bshum tries it and sees what explodes 
2015-01-09T14:21:51  <dbs> bshum: we've been doing concurrency 2 for years
2015-01-09T14:22:50  <csharp> PINES uses '-c 12' nowadays
2015-01-09T14:27:33  * jeff idly wonders if anyone has run a report in the last year other than a few legacy ones he's run by hand

2015-01-09T14:40:24  <Tracy> Yes. I'm from the Lake County Library and am a new hire for Technical Services Assistant.
2015-01-09T14:42:40  <jeff> congratulations!
2015-01-09T14:43:36  <Tracy_> I don't have any questions for the homework this week.  But am logging in for the first time to get acquainted with the chat room and to fulfill my assignment of logging in at least once per week!

2015-01-09T15:09:52  * dbs suspects that the display_field approach may benefit significantly from postgresql 9.3 and LATERAL
2015-01-09T15:10:06  <kmlussier> #evergreen often gives me a warm fuzzy feeling inside.
2015-01-09T15:11:00  <bshum> dbs: Does that mean that we should make a hard requirement to use PG 9.3 for 2.8+ ?  (I already feel like PG 9.3 should have been the base version for 2.7, but anyways....)
2015-01-09T15:11:24  <dbs> otherwise, pre-9.3 approach seems likely to be another materialized table populated by triggers. could be just my little brain not dealing well with attempts to harness biblio.extract_metabib_field_entry(bibid)  for the powers of good
2015-01-09T15:12:41  <dbs> bshum: 9.1 end of life is September 2016
2015-01-09T15:13:36  <bshum> Oh, that'll line up nicely with 3.0 then ;)
2015-01-09T15:13:37  <dbs> (per http://www.postgresql.org/support/versioning/) - 9.3 minimum + dropping script-based circ + newfangled websocketry all sounds like a good thing to get in place for an upcoming release
2015-01-09T15:13:58  <dbs> 2.10? :)
2015-01-09T15:14:04  <bshum> Nooooooo
2015-01-09T15:14:05  <bshum> :)
2015-01-09T15:15:00  <bshum> I imagine that 3.0 would be a good marketing concept for the day we can officially cut the cord between the XUL and web based staff clients.

2015-01-09T15:24:42  <kmlussier> Are display fields doable for 2.8?
2015-01-09T15:32:35  <dbs> kmlussier: some elements of them would be. not sure what the whole desired scope is
2015-01-09T15:33:30  <kmlussier> dbs: Nor do I.
2015-01-09T15:36:20  *** Sally has quit IRC
2015-01-09T15:48:52  <eeevil> dbs / kmlussier: re display fields, the full scope would be TPAC + replace MVR + reporting (and likely more), so probably not all for 2.8, but I think TPAC and reporting might be
2015-01-09T15:50:20  <eeevil> dbs: and, IIRC, I think display fields could (is planned to?) reuse browse_entry, since the data in there is focused on patron display normalization already, to avoid another copy of /all/ the data
2015-01-09T15:50:33  <eeevil> but, going from memory on that second part
2015-01-09T15:51:01  <kmlussier> eeevil: What would display fields do for TPAC? I think I've asked this question before, but I don't remember the answer now.
2015-01-09T15:52:02  <jeff> for one thing, they could eliminate the need for tpac to parse the MARCXML blob for every item on every search result page.
2015-01-09T15:53:02  <berick> kmlussier: remove all the xpath cruft from the templates and just display pre-cacluated values from the DB for record fields
2015-01-09T15:53:35  <kmlussier> berick: Gotcha! Thanks
2015-01-09T15:53:36  <jeff> (unless you wanted to override without re-ingest, in which case the marcxml would still be available to you)
2015-01-09T15:53:39  <berick> what jeff said, in an ideal world, but completetly getting rid of all xpath/parsing would be a significant job, i think
2015-01-09T15:53:46  <berick> jeff: that, too
2015-01-09T15:58:19  <kmlussier> I wish I understood reports better.
2015-01-09T15:58:42  <bshum> kmlussier: Be careful what you wish for.
2015-01-09T15:59:15  <kmlussier> When you use the "in list" operator on a filter, why is it that you sometimes are presented with a list of defined values when you create the report, but other times you have to enter the text?
2015-01-09T16:01:46  <bshum> Maybe it's a goof in the fieldmapper?
2015-01-09T16:01:54  <bshum> And it doesn't know where to get the list from
2015-01-09T16:02:01  <kmlussier> For example, I can get a nice list of org unit IDS to choose from or a list of fund codes to choose from. But if I want to filter by PO state, I need to manually enter the text.
2015-01-09T16:02:43  <Stompro> Should there be a post on evergreen-ils.org and something to the list serves about EG 2.7.2, 2.6.5 and Opensrf 2.4.0?  The last release post is for 2.7.1, 2.6.4 and 2.5.8.  I've been out for a month and I'm just trying to caught up.
2015-01-09T16:03:06  <jeff> back when we used to run reports that way (okay, I'll stop), I seem to recall two common causes: a lack of proper linkage in the fieldmapper, or selecting the "wrong" element in the report template editor.
2015-01-09T16:03:06  <bshum> Stompro: In theory, we should probably blog more.  In practice, that isn't always the case.
2015-01-09T16:04:15  <berick> eeevil: IIRC, there was talk of using browse_entry for display fields, but no action.
2015-01-09T16:04:17  <berick> all talk, no walk
2015-01-09T16:04:46  <kmlussier> jeff: OK, so maybe I need to find the "right" element.
2015-01-09T16:05:01  <bshum> kmlussier: What is PO State related to?  (is that an actual state, like CT?)
2015-01-09T16:05:09  <berick> kmlussier: PO states do not come from a list maintained in the DB.
2015-01-09T16:05:14  <eeevil> sorry, looked away ... /me reads up
2015-01-09T16:05:22  <kmlussier> I'm copying a report from a reports guru where the same thing happens, so I suspect the cause is the former not the latter.
2015-01-09T16:05:24  <jeff> ah, then there'd you go. berick has the true reason in this case.
2015-01-09T16:05:29  *** julialima has left #evergreen
2015-01-09T16:06:02  <kmlussier> berick: Really? I always assumed there was because there was a limited number of states that could be used.
2015-01-09T16:06:13  <kmlussier> berick: And the same is true for lineitem states?
2015-01-09T16:06:40  <kmlussier> bshum: State as in pending, on order, complete, etc.
2015-01-09T16:06:41  <bshum> Oh state, got it now...
2015-01-09T16:06:44  <bshum> :)
2015-01-09T16:07:05  <berick> kmlussier: same for lineitems.
2015-01-09T16:07:22  <kmlussier> OK, then. I won't worry about it and move on. At least I now know the answer to a question that has been bugging me for a while. :)
2015-01-09T16:08:16  <kmlussier> Actually, I lied about moving on.
2015-01-09T16:08:22  <berick> kmlussier++
2015-01-09T16:08:45  <kmlussier> berick: So that would explain why, when you do an acquisitions search, you can't select a state from a nice dropdown box? That's something that's been on our wishlist for a while.
2015-01-09T16:09:04  <berick> kmlussier: yep
2015-01-09T16:09:40  <berick> should be possible to put a custom state-picker widget into the search form, though
2015-01-09T16:10:18  <kmlussier> berick: Possible as in hours and hours of development or possible as in an easy tweak?
2015-01-09T16:10:36  <berick> hm, somewhere in the middle
2015-01-09T16:10:51  <kmlussier> berick: Good to know for the next time it comes up. Thanks!
