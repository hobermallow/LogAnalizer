2015-01-12T09:17:56  <Dyrcona> Well, I'm on the guest wireless at work, but don't feel like correcting that right now.
2015-01-12T09:18:13  <Dyrcona> One thing I can tell you is that spreading cstore around didn't help in and of itself.
2015-01-12T09:18:34  <Dyrcona> Apparently, tsbere did that over the weekend and we had trouble again yesterday morning.
2015-01-12T09:18:56  <Dyrcona> Here's what I think is our real problem with the load on the server and it becoming unresponsive.
2015-01-12T09:19:28  <Dyrcona> After some digging, I did determine that ejabberd is being limited to 1024/4096 file handles because of how it is started.
2015-01-12T09:20:05  <Dyrcona> Typically, when things are "normal" it uses betwee 500 and 650 file handles.
2015-01-12T09:20:31  <Dyrcona> However, when we hit 200 cstore drones and things are busy, I believe it goes over the 1024 soft limit.
2015-01-12T09:21:06  <Dyrcona> (I can't find it, but I believe I recall seeing it using somewhere around 3000 file handles during one of these episodes last week.)
2015-01-12T09:22:08  <Dyrcona> So, what I think happens ejabberd tries to keep up with incoming requests but can't, as it runs out of file handles.
2015-01-12T09:22:10  <kmlussier> Thanks csharp for the info on reports!
2015-01-12T09:22:33  <Dyrcona> This is where I think the load spikes are coming from, 'cause ejabberd usually looks like it has gone berserk in top.
2015-01-12T09:23:58  <Dyrcona> So, I've made the changes suggested by eeevil and a couple of blog posts so that ejabberd should get the settings from limits.conf when restarted.
2015-01-12T09:24:17  <Dyrcona> When this happens today, I'll not only restart services, but clobber ejabberd as well.
2015-01-12T09:24:55  <Dyrcona> If ejabberd doesn't get the settings when restarted manually, I'll reboot the server.
2015-01-12T09:25:12  <Dyrcona> Hopefully, it won't take a reboot for the settings to take effect.
2015-01-12T09:25:22  <Dyrcona> After all, this isn't Windows. :)
2015-01-12T09:28:30  <Dyrcona> Where this seems to help our situation or not, we're going ahead with our plans to experiment with clustered ejabberd.

2015-01-12T09:54:13  <dbs> that google symptom happens a lot with ejabberd :)
2015-01-12T09:55:18  <Dyrcona> So, here's a fun thing.
2015-01-12T09:55:43  <Dyrcona> dbs: Yep, it does.
2015-01-12T09:55:54  <Dyrcona> I requested a DVD back in early Decemeber.
2015-01-12T09:56:02  <Dyrcona> It had been in transit for 4 weeks.
2015-01-12T09:56:44  <Dyrcona> I aborted the transit, set the copy to missing, and targeted the hold at a new copy.
2015-01-12T09:56:58  <Dyrcona> An hour later, the original DVD shows up in delivery.
2015-01-12T09:58:38  <Dyrcona> And, yay for "Checkout fills related hold."
2015-01-12T09:59:02  <Dyrcona> I find that Google symptom happens a lot with erlang.
2015-01-12T09:59:26  <Dyrcona> I think I should go to some of these erlang seminars/training that I keep seeing in the G+ erlang community.
2015-01-12T09:59:45  <Dyrcona> I read the O'Reilly book a couple of years ago, but know I'm missing the best stuff about erlang.

2015-01-12T11:40:44  <abowling> i'm looking to map a field in a perl module through json_query. i'm finding aliases such as "bre" for biblio.record_entry. Can someone point me to where those aliases are set?
2015-01-12T11:43:59  <berick> abowling: /openils/conf/fm_IDL.xml
2015-01-12T11:44:09  <berick> class="bre"
2015-01-12T11:44:22  <jeff> they originate in the fieldmapper fm_IDL.xml file. there are some ways to programmatically map between things, but we'd probably need more context.

2015-01-12T14:44:53  <berick> or am I being too literal about that?
2015-01-12T14:45:10  <dbs> You might want to talk to the contributor first?
2015-01-12T14:45:30  <berick> does pullrequest mean "it's ready now" or "help me finish this thing and get it merged"?

2015-01-12T14:46:23  <bshum> If commentors are stating issues, then I think it's fair to remove the pullrequest and mark the bug with status "incomplete" pending further action by the original contributor.

2015-01-12T15:10:07  <jboyer-isl> I’ve tried to shoe-horn a little too much into my ansible playbook for evergreen. It currently tries to manage everything from the vhmosts to the DNS servers. I need to break it up into more managable pieces.
2015-01-12T15:12:07  <jboyer-isl> But Ansible as a system is very nice to work with. The entire VM build and install software step took only a single command and a pizza.
