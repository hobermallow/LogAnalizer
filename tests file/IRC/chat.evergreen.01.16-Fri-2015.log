2015-01-16T09:16:17  <Dyrcona> I should probably ask in #launchpad, but does the Hide function in comments actually hide it from everyone or just from your current session?
2015-01-16T09:16:29  <Dyrcona> I thought it only did the latter.
2015-01-16T09:17:34  <kmlussier> Dunno. Send me a link to a Launchpad bug where you hid a comment and I'll let you know if I can see it. :)
2015-01-16T09:18:17  <Dyrcona> kmlussier: That's OK. It's academic at this point.
2015-01-16T09:18:39  <kmlussier> If it only hides it from you for a given session, it seems rather useless.
2015-01-16T09:18:50  <Dyrcona> Also, is launchpad based on MoinMoin? If not, the help search is just as bad as regular search.
2015-01-16T09:19:20  <Dyrcona> kmlussier: Agreed, but I've seen less useful features implemented on web sites before.
2015-01-16T09:21:21  <Dyrcona> Apparently, the help search is just as bad as regular launchpad search.
2015-01-16T09:22:19  <Dyrcona> Ah. The help is based on MoinMoin wiki....
2015-01-16T09:22:51  <Dyrcona> So, I when I search for help on comments, I got the help for the comments on MoinMoin. Still not useful.
2015-01-16T09:23:35  <Dyrcona> +1 to ditching Launchpad for just about anything else, even a set of index cards stored in a disused Kensington lavatory with a sign on the door saying beware of leopard.

2015-01-16T10:52:50  <jboyer-isl> csharp, I just had a thought re: pg replication vs slony. Are all of your DBs running the same (or similar) hardware?

2015-01-16T10:53:17  <jboyer-isl> Since we have such lopsided power on our primary vs. reports I think we've got some bad query plans floating around because the primary can do whatever while our reporter is practically an antique.

2015-01-16T14:37:22  <jeffdavis> We've had a request to optionally allow patrons to renew items when they've hit their max fine amount. "Optionally" as in some of our libraries want this to be possible and some don't.
2015-01-16T14:38:02  <jeffdavis> I was thinking of modifying the action.item_user_circ_test db function so that, if the patron has the PATRON_EXCEEDS_FINES penalty, EG checks an org setting to decide whether to override the block and permit the renewal.
2015-01-16T14:38:10  <Dyrcona> jeffdavis: Kick the ones who want to out of the consortium. :)
2015-01-16T14:38:48  <jeffdavis> Dyrcona: True, the easiest solution to many problems would be to have no patrons and no member libraries. :)
2015-01-16T14:38:58  <jeffdavis> Does that approach seem reasonable, or am I opening a can of worms there?
2015-01-16T14:39:09  <jeffdavis> (The actual suggested approach, not getting rid of all users.)
2015-01-16T14:39:42  <Dyrcona> I'd have to give it some more thought.
2015-01-16T14:40:25  <Dyrcona> My initial reaction was to create a new penalty for exceeds fines that doesn't block renewals, but then you'd have to figure out how to apply it.
2015-01-16T14:40:58  <Dyrcona> Another question is who decides, the library doing the renewal, the library that applied the block, or the library that owns the item?
2015-01-16T14:41:48  <Dyrcona> Though, I guess a library doesn't apply the block does it?
2015-01-16T14:42:02  <Dyrcona> We can change that to "the library that circ'd the item."
2015-01-16T14:42:18  <jeffdavis> Yeah, basing it on circ lib's org setting was my thinking.
2015-01-16T14:43:38  <kmlussier> "[TADL] also happens to be the most user-friendly and inviting Evergreen catalog landing page out there, at least of the ones I’ve seen." Did you see that jeff? :)
2015-01-16T14:44:20  * Dyrcona didn't see that, and I cannot say that I disagree. Where did that come from?
2015-01-16T14:45:10  <Dyrcona> jeffdavis: I can see how others might want to base it on who owns the copy or something else, but I hesitate to suggest another setting or flag for that.
2015-01-16T14:45:19  <kmlussier> Dyrcona: The general list. Alexey's email regarding call number shelf browse.
2015-01-16T14:45:43  <Dyrcona> kmlussier: OK. I likely haven't read that one yet.
2015-01-16T14:47:36  <jeff> kmlussier: thanks for calling that out. i've been reading that thread but apparently am not current.

2015-01-16T14:52:32  <kmlussier> eeevil / berick: If you're still around, there were 4 bug fixes mentioned in Mike's most recent bug repairs comment that I was unsure on what to test for. http://pastebin.com/r21hv2ke
2015-01-16T14:53:19  <kmlussier> Some may be related to other fixes to be tested there, but I just want to make sure I'm not missing anything.
2015-01-16T14:53:39  <berick> kmlussier: for "Repair browser client dropdown buttons" -- it's an issue that would only appear on a fairly new server
2015-01-16T14:54:05  *** mrpeters has left #evergreen
2015-01-16T14:54:08  <berick> in the grids, the Actions drop-down buttons don't work w/o the patch
2015-01-16T14:54:22  <berick> making sure they still work on older servers would be helpful, thoug
2015-01-16T14:54:23  <berick> h
2015-01-16T14:54:23  <kmlussier> berick: Ok. So the 1st isn't something I can really test for on webby?
2015-01-16T14:55:02  <berick> checking Actions dropdowns in Webby to make sure the change didn't introduce a problem would be good
2015-01-16T14:55:10  <kmlussier> berick: Sure, that we can do. :)
2015-01-16T14:55:55  <berick> kmlussier: for "Avoid org tree retrieval race condition on patron app" -- without this patch, pages would sometimes fail to load with a JS error.  if you never saw the problem before, it's not really testable, apart from "hey, pages load!"
2015-01-16T14:56:33  * kmlussier doesn't recall seeing that problem and therefore won't worry about it.
2015-01-16T14:59:07  <RoganH> kmlussier: it's like evolution, you can always deny it and make your own reality
2015-01-16T15:03:19  <kmlussier> RoganH: :)

2015-01-16T15:14:29  <jeffdavis> I created bug 1411819 (is there a way to mark it as a feature request?).
2015-01-16T15:14:29  <pinesol_green> Launchpad bug 1411819 in Evergreen "Allow patron renewal on max fines for some libraries, disallow it for others" (affected: 1, heat: 6) [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1411819
2015-01-16T15:15:27  <jeff> jeffdavis: i set importance to "wishlist" -- that's the convention so far, iirc.
2015-01-16T15:15:35  <jeffdavis> thanks!
2015-01-16T15:15:45  <dbs> like bug 1411820

2015-01-16T15:15:59  * dbs pluralizes that
2015-01-16T15:16:58  <jeffdavis> I'm planning to have a "fix" for 1411819 by the end of the month. I outlined my proposal in the bug report but happy to hear about alternative approaches/objections.

2015-01-16T15:30:42  <tsbere> jeffdavis: An alternative might be another "result" field in the circ matrix for ignoring penalty blocks. Then you wouldn't be limited to just "by org unit" but could mix in other details like patron type. And easily cover item owning lib vs circ lib differences, for that matter.
2015-01-16T15:31:21  * tsbere shakes his fist at launchpad throwing login errors at him
2015-01-16T15:31:41  <eeevil> jeffdavis: I've been thinking about the hardcoded penalties for a while, actually, and was thinking that a "penalty event map" would be a good way to address it. each org could map an event to a penalty, including custom ones. it would default to the current hard-coded ones if no penalty was mapped
2015-01-16T15:31:55  <Dyrcona> tsbere jeffdavis: And, though most ignore it, there is a is_renewal flag on circ_matrix_matchpoints, so it could apply only to renewals.
2015-01-16T15:38:46  <eeevil> kmlussier: the third bug is part of another, I just didn't move it. it's the grid sorting feature
2015-01-16T15:39:50  <eeevil> kmlussier: the forth, there was a bug about how you could select, say, "current copy" on the hold pull list and it would show a pile of JSON data. now we hide that column from selection
2015-01-16T15:41:55  <kmlussier> eeevil: Thanks!

2015-01-16T16:17:44  <dbs> (takes a given record, does a lookup using OCLC's xID service by LCCN, ISBN, or OCLC number, and adds any identifiers that might be missing so we can then link out to them)
2015-01-16T16:18:21  <dbs> along with other miscellaneous cleanup. going to take forever at the default 1,000 xID api calls per day though :)
