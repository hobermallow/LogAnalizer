2015-01-22T02:58:24  * dbs going a bit nuts trying to use Acq; funds show up in Batch Update fund picker scoped to our OU, but won't show up in the line item details fund picker when I try to add a copy.
2015-01-22T03:00:24  <dbs> http://i.imgur.com/tqfTD4Q.png?1
2015-01-22T03:01:37  * dbs wonders if maybe everyone using acquisitions is using funds at the Consortium level
2015-01-22T03:11:24  <dbs> If I create a purchase order from the selection list, however, then I can select the Fund at the individual copy level
2015-01-22T03:11:47  <dbs> which makes me think that the selector isn't expected to actually select the fund. hmm.
2015-01-22T03:15:20  <dbs> Interesting. So in our workflow, the selectors generally say what they want to order, and what fund to apply that order to, but the acq people figure out the provider (Amazon, B&T, whatever)
2015-01-22T03:17:23  <dbs> Looks like you have to choose the provider when you create the PO, then you can choose the fund, but that's the opposite of our workflow.
2015-01-22T03:17:46  <dbs> And looks like there's no way to change the provider after the PO is created but before it is activated.
2015-01-22T03:19:29  <dbs> I guesss for Coutts at least we can try to make Load MARC Order Records work; then focus on the one-offs for the non-Coutts orders
2015-01-22T03:19:42  <dbs> Should be a fun session with our acq people tomorrow
2015-01-22T07:17:35  <csharp> dbs: yeah - the OU scoping for different acq things is confusing to our libraries too
2015-01-22T07:18:24  <csharp> the funds are owned by individual branches, but the orders are all placed at the system level (iirc) and that creates confusion for everyone (including vendors)

2015-01-22T08:40:00  <dbs> I went over acq admin with our admin people last week, am introducing ordering to our technicians this morning
2015-01-22T08:40:15  <csharp> cool
2015-01-22T08:40:22  <csharp> I'll be interested in how it all goes
2015-01-22T08:40:52  <dbs> Bar should be low: make ordering less painful than updating a big old spreadsheet + local fields in each MARC record along with the actual provider site
2015-01-22T08:40:55  <dbs> we'll see.
2015-01-22T08:40:55  <csharp> we're piloting one (maybe two) libraries for acquisitions in the coming months
2015-01-22T08:42:04  <csharp> the biggest headache I've had to deal with is EDI setup (and specifically FTP) because when it fails there's not a straightforward way to re-do things
2015-01-22T08:42:44  <csharp> and of course, the Ruby bits
2015-01-22T08:45:02  <dbs> no plans for EDI here in the near future. Loading MARC Order Records is likely though.
2015-01-22T08:45:32  <csharp> that has been an adventure for us too, having little practical vandelay experience
2015-01-22T08:46:09  <bshum> Better than it used to be anyways ;)
2015-01-22T08:47:38  <bshum> Unrelated, I didn't get to cutting a new maintenance release of 2.7 yesterday by the calendar.  The day ended up a bit more exciting in other areas.
2015-01-22T08:48:01  <bshum> Hoping to take a look at pulling a few fixes in before the next cut.
2015-01-22T08:49:31  <bshum> I'll likely aim to put together a 2.7.3 this evening.
2015-01-22T08:49:50  <bshum> So fix, fix away
2015-01-22T08:51:45  <dbs> highly critical fixes like <table> <table> ? :)

2015-01-22T09:24:39  <Dyrcona> If anyone else wants to jump in, just say what service you're looking at.
2015-01-22T09:28:58  <jboyer-isl> I had a question about the various services. Is the intention for there to always be pcrud and cstore (and qstore? I don't know what uses that off hand) or is this the middle of a transition where pcrud is old and broken and cstore is the new hotness?
2015-01-22T09:30:55  <tsbere> jboyer-isl: As I understand it, cstore is "backend, no auth needed" and pcrud is "frontend, auth needed". rstore is a reporting(?) version of cstore. qstore is unrelated.
2015-01-22T09:31:48  <jboyer-isl> ok, so likely they're all going to be around long-term. Thanks tsbere.

2015-01-22T09:51:35  <bshum> I thought qstore was dead?
2015-01-22T09:51:55  <bshum> I guess I already thought we started ripping it out.  But I guess maybe I was wrong on that.

2015-01-22T09:59:02  <jboyer-isl> It appears my confusion on the qstore front is because it's still in opensrf.xml, but it's not in any of the service lists in opensrf_core.xml. So it's not on, but it's not really gone, either.
2015-01-22T10:01:40  <Dyrcona> jboyer-isl: AFAIK, nothing at all uses qstore.
2015-01-22T10:02:10  <Dyrcona> The code code be removed, but no one has bothered.
2015-01-22T10:02:30  <Dyrcona> If you have it still configured to start, you should turn it off.
2015-01-22T10:03:13  <Dyrcona> And I should have read what everyone else said before replying.
2015-01-22T10:04:25  <Dyrcona> Too bad we can't set a bug's status to deprecated.... I'd be inclined to set that bug to invalid and create a new one to rip qstore out.
2015-01-22T10:05:02  <bshum> "won't fix"
2015-01-22T10:05:09  <bshum> i.e. not in project plans
2015-01-22T10:05:54  <jboyer-isl> Invalid + new bug sounds like a fine plan to me. Maybe a comment could be dropped in the bug before it's closed for software archaeologists.
2015-01-22T10:06:13  <jboyer-isl> O, what bshum said. :)
2015-01-22T10:08:27  <Dyrcona> Yeah, +1 to won't fix.
2015-01-22T10:09:08  <Dyrcona> I'll do it later and file a bug for ripping out qstore, but I've got some other things I should do, first.
2015-01-22T10:19:45  * eeevil would hate to see qstore go away ... it's meant to support batch operations. but if it gets ripped out, it should be done in one fell swoop (please), so the commit can be reverted if it's needed later
2015-01-22T10:22:27  <Dyrcona> Hmm. Then maybe we should make use of qstore for batch operations instead of what we do now?

2015-01-22T10:43:54  <eeevil> and, re qstore, it's just part of the puzzle, but yes. the idea was to let it manage batch change setup and supply completion state information for a polling UI to refresh regularly.  it also has a "remember old state" feature, IIRC, so you can say "hey, that named changeset that I ran a month ago to move copies to another branch? yeah, undo that now."

2015-01-22T10:47:50  <Dyrcona> eeevil: That sounds pretty cool. We already set a table up to store temporary copy changes, like moving stuff to/from Summer Reading copy locs and so on.
2015-01-22T11:03:09  <csharp> since upgrading, we are no longer able to place "unfillable holds" - it gets to the screen where it says " You have permission to override some of the failed holds.

2015-01-22T14:46:15  <Stompro> Is creating read only postgres access really as difficult as it seems to be?  Needing to run a command for every schema individually?
2015-01-22T14:50:32  <bshum> Stompro: I believe that's how we had to do it in the past.
2015-01-22T14:50:48  <bshum> And actually I think we even went further and specified it table by table in some cases.
2015-01-22T14:51:19  <bshum> So we had to grant usage for the schemas
2015-01-22T14:51:24  <bshum> And then grant select on each table

2015-01-22T14:55:26  <jeffdavis> You may wish to adjust the WHERE clauses if there are other tables you don't want your read-only user to have access to, of course.
2015-01-22T14:58:20  <kmlussier> dbwells: We loaded collab/dbwells/1198465_cstore_fines_gen in our dev environment (we being Dyrcona). However, we're getting the following when starting up the client: Method [open-ils.circ.circ_modifier.retrieve.all] not found for OpenILS::Application::Circ
2015-01-22T14:58:22  <jeffdavis> Oh, and to be clear that just outputs the commands that you need to run, it doesn't actually run them. You can put the output in a script and run that.
2015-01-22T15:04:41  <collum> Stompro: here's a quick way to find out what schema.tables a user has the 'select' privilege on.  http://pastebin.com/PmSKmM7k  Just change 'username' in the script to the user.
2015-01-22T15:05:14  <jeff> kmlussier: first thing I check in that scenario is for syntax errors in OpenILS/Application/Circ.pm
2015-01-22T15:07:13  <Dyrcona> jeff: We did that, and if there were syntax errors that bublle up to Circ.pm, circ would not start.
2015-01-22T15:07:23  <Dyrcona> open-ils.circ started.

2015-01-22T15:25:24  <kmlussier> So I could make a comment on the bug saying just that and assign it to myself. :)

2015-01-22T15:31:22  <dbwells> kmlussier: rats, sorry.  Probably a merge error I made of some kind when getting it into the branch.  I loaded the branch earlier on my test box, but haven't gotten back to it yet.  I'll get it fixed.

2015-01-22T15:40:02  <Dyrcona> Yep, that's what I did, since most commits follow that pattern.
2015-01-22T15:40:04  <jeff> but that might just be because most of my terminals select the digits and not the LP# when i double-click the digits.
2015-01-22T15:40:14  <bshum> What jeff said works.  Sometimes people do LP#number: (with a colon at the end)

2015-01-22T15:40:22  <Dyrcona> I added the colon.
2015-01-22T15:40:28  <jeff> and a trailing colon wastes a precious character :-)
2015-01-22T15:40:28  <Dyrcona> Well, there, you can see.
2015-01-22T15:40:40  <jeff> heh
2015-01-22T15:40:55  <Dyrcona> A trailing colon sounds painful.

2015-01-22T16:26:16  <jeff> are the -developer and -packager makefile targets intended to never be both installed?
2015-01-22T16:28:10  <bshum> jeff: I thought developer was a subunit of packager.  Meaning if you ask for packager, it'll also call the stuff in developer.
2015-01-22T16:28:25  <bshum> Something weird going on?
2015-01-22T16:28:27  <jeff> i suppose that would have been the obvious thing for me to check.

2015-01-22T16:29:28  <Dyrcona> bshum: I notice you're pushing a lot of stuff to 2.6 also. Should I push the symbols popup fix branch to 2.6? I guess it is also a question for dbwells.
2015-01-22T16:29:29  <bshum> So I wouldn't expect a problem to call either or
2015-01-22T16:30:22  <jeff> bshum: install_packager calls install_developer, you are correct.
2015-01-22T16:30:51  <bshum> Dyrcona: Most of the things I end up pushing to 2.7 tend to be either tiny or broken things.  I usually save dbwells the trouble of pushing it to rel_2_6 on his behalf, but I could change that if he'd prefer to push it himself :)
2015-01-22T16:31:04  <kmlussier> Dyrcona++ Thank you!
2015-01-22T16:31:44  <jeff> bshum: so trying to install debian-wheezy-packager target after installing debian-wheezy-developer results in an error because it tries to clone the node git repo a second time.
2015-01-22T16:31:46  <bshum> If it was me, I wouldn't hold off on backporting if it's indeed a bug fix.

2015-01-22T16:33:53  <jeff> might be as simple as clarifying the README (assuming it isn't already clear and I misread) to point out that it's either-or, not both.
2015-01-22T16:35:28  <bshum> jeff: Ideally I think it ought to handle both.
2015-01-22T16:35:47  <bshum> Meaning if I start off with the developer package, but want to grow up to be a packager on behalf of the project, it shouldn't blow up on me.
2015-01-22T16:35:57  * jeff nods
2015-01-22T16:43:06  <bshum> jeff: I wonder if we added some sort of check to see if the node directory was already cloned
2015-01-22T16:43:10  <bshum> Or existing I mean
2015-01-22T16:43:15  <bshum> And if so, move on
2015-01-22T16:43:49  <dbwells> Dyrcona: If a fix for 2.7 also applies to 2.6, please feel free to push it in.  Does that answer your question, or did I misunderstand?
2015-01-22T16:44:11  <Dyrcona> dbwells; That answers the question. I didn't want to step on RM toes.
2015-01-22T16:44:16  <bshum> jeff: Course then the next step after that to checkout the branch would fail too, cause the branch would already be checked out...
2015-01-22T16:44:17  <bshum> Hmm
2015-01-22T16:45:14  <bshum> Maybe like the install_libdbi thing before install_nodejs_from_source
2015-01-22T16:45:28  <bshum> Where we look for the folder, if not present, get it, etc.
2015-01-22T16:45:38  <dbwells> I think whoever does the testing should go ahead and push to all applicable branches.  The fact that bshum is an RM and also tests a bunch of things just confuses the situation ;)
2015-01-22T16:46:00  * bshum either has lots of hats or lots of heads.
2015-01-22T16:46:12  <bshum> Possibly both.
2015-01-22T16:47:54  <bshum> jeff: That's of course all from Makefile.common I'm curiously looking at.
2015-01-22T16:49:00  <Dyrcona> dbwells kmlussier: I'm still getting the error with the branch installed. I even made sure to git fetch before making a new branch.

2015-01-22T16:53:24  <dbwells> Dyrcona: I'm sorry it's probably still some problem on my end.  Or maybe you just did a 'git fetch' and not 'git fetch working'?  Again, the problem is probably my fault, so just a suggestion.

2015-01-22T16:55:02  <Dyrcona> I'll just build a new vm on Saturday or Monday.
2015-01-22T16:55:13  <kmlussier> Dyrcona: Thanks for trying!

2015-01-22T17:01:36  <pinesol_green> Launchpad bug 1413624 in Evergreen "New AccessHandler Module" (affected: 1, heat: 8) [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1413624
2015-01-22T17:02:54  <eeevil> dbwells: I've been terribly remiss in not looking at your cstore-fine-gen code ... I'm wondering what the reason for that is? (the use of cstore instead of dbi in the storage app, in particular) ... but, I think I've found a problem in any case. it looks like penalty calculation is being called before the cstore->commit is called
2015-01-22T17:03:11  <eeevil> so, fine-oriented penalties won't have fresh data...

2015-01-22T17:10:32  <dbwells> eeevil: Thanks for looking at it.  I'll check out what your saying about the penalty calc, and thank goodness I don't have to relive how I arrived at this path.

2015-01-22T17:12:52  <berick> dbwells: in a nutshell, "make it possible to run the whole circ shebang, including fine generation, in a single transaction" ?
2015-01-22T17:15:39  <dbwells> berick: yep, that's the gist.  Just don't ask me why, at least not this late in the day :)
2015-01-22T17:16:05  <dbwells> although, it's starting to come back to me
2015-01-22T17:16:59  <berick> i have a pretty good idea why, at least in part.. I won't ask you to re-live it :)
2015-01-22T17:23:14  <dbwells> eeevil: yep, I see what you mean.  I think it'll be easy enough to fix for the backwards compat calls, but penalty generation will have to become responsibility of any code passing in their own transaction.
