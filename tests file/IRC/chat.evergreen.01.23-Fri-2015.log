2015-01-23T13:50:00  <kmlussier> All release do include a linux client, don't they?
2015-01-23T13:50:23  <goood> kmlussier: I believe so
2015-01-23T13:50:45  <bshum> kmlussier: We do put up the linux clients nowadays.
2015-01-23T13:51:18  <kmlussier> Sorry, I was just remarking on a list email in channel.
2015-01-23T13:56:02  <jboyer-isl> kmlussier, You have to build them yourself, but yes, they're in there. As someone who has built a couple Mac clients, it is a very manual process (And requires a Mac at minimum, possibly a Windows machine too, because you've got to use the Window's client's guts).
2015-01-23T13:56:21  <jboyer-isl> 'too 'much 'like 'scheme...
2015-01-23T13:57:18  <dbs> Linux clients are a cinch to build.
2015-01-23T13:57:33  <dbs> tsbere++
2015-01-23T13:57:34  <bshum> kmlussier: Yeah on the downloads page, we have links to the 32 and 64-bit linux clients
2015-01-23T13:57:51  <bshum> And you basically just rip out the innards of an Evergreen app on a Mac and put the 64-bit linux files in there.
2015-01-23T13:57:57  <bshum> And edit the info file
2015-01-23T13:58:02  <bshum> To make it compatible.
2015-01-23T13:58:47  <kmlussier> I don't have a Mac, so it's hard for me to picture it, but it might be a fun thing to try doing someday. If I had a Mac, that is.
2015-01-23T13:58:48  <jboyer-isl> Ah, that's better than installing the Windows version and digging through folders.
2015-01-23T13:58:50  <bshum> I would build Mac clients, but I don't officially own a mac anymore.
2015-01-23T13:59:09  <bshum> I used to do it, back when I had a Mac of my own.
2015-01-23T13:59:22  <bshum> If Ashbury bought me a Mac, I would guarantee community Mac clients for them :)

2015-01-23T14:01:41  <jboyer-isl> I don't mind doing it if release maintainers ping me when new releases are out.
2015-01-23T14:02:49  <Dyrcona> You could theoretically build a mac client on Linux. It just isn't easy.
2015-01-23T14:03:09  <Dyrcona> XulRunner on Mac OS X is very iffy, though.
2015-01-23T14:03:24  <bshum> It's brittle.

2015-01-23T14:03:25  <Dyrcona> I've had all kinds of problems in the past with the UI being broken.
2015-01-23T14:03:25  <kmlussier> bshum: You should extend the offer to them. Sounds like a bargain to me. :)
2015-01-23T14:03:28  <jeff> s/on Mac OS X // even
2015-01-23T14:04:00  <Dyrcona> jeff: heh.
2015-01-23T14:04:02  <bshum> Dyrcona: It's still broken in certain places.  Like backgrounds not being filled in.  or rendering errors.
2015-01-23T14:04:14  <jeff> the transparent errors quirk is fun.
2015-01-23T14:04:29  <kmlussier> If we took jboyer-isl up on his offer, then, would we put Mac clients on the download page too?
2015-01-23T14:05:06  <Dyrcona> bshum If you try running a XUL app via command line: xulrunner --app /path/to/whatever.whateverextension, then anything you type goes to the console, and not the text widgets.
2015-01-23T14:05:26  <tsbere> As a general note on client building: The "generic client" is probably the best one to grab for mac builds. In part because the resulting file has no binaries.
2015-01-23T14:05:27  <jboyer-isl> I have to say I've not noticed too many issues with it, but that's at home and I may not be hitting the same things that other people run into.
2015-01-23T14:06:04  <Dyrcona> It might work better if run via firefox --app ....
2015-01-23T14:06:14  <bshum> kmlussier: I have mixed feelings, but I guess it's not different than what we do now for "official releases" where volunteers make everything anyways.
2015-01-23T14:06:16  <bshum> :D
2015-01-23T14:06:50  <jboyer-isl> tsbere, that is a good tip. I've never bothered grabbing a windows install dir in the past because it has to be the same release as the one on my laptop, but this would be different.
2015-01-23T14:07:02  <jboyer-isl> "never been bothered," that is.
2015-01-23T14:07:25  <kmlussier> bshum: Why the mixed feelings?
2015-01-23T14:07:42  <bshum> kmlussier: Mostly in that if something went wrong with the client, I couldn't help to support it.
2015-01-23T14:07:47  <bshum> Since I don't have a Mac.
2015-01-23T14:07:54  <Dyrcona> I've found taking the generic client and running the xulrunner --install_app or whatever option on it, creates a Mac OS X .app that seems to work OK>
2015-01-23T14:08:15  <Dyrcona> You have to do that on a Mac, of course.
2015-01-23T14:08:21  <tsbere> jboyer-isl: Oh, and supposedly there is a way to take said generic client, run with the appropriate xulrunner version and specific command lines, and turn it into an installed mac app.
2015-01-23T14:08:22  <bshum> So if we build it, people use it, and they say "X is broken", we can't help them.
2015-01-23T14:08:22  <kmlussier> bshum: Ah, I see what you're saying. So it's a question of whether there are enough people in the community who can support issues that arise with a Mac client?
2015-01-23T14:08:23  * Dyrcona no longer has a Mac that works.
2015-01-23T14:08:47  <tsbere> jboyer-isl: Ahh, what Dyrcona was just talking about
2015-01-23T14:08:55  <Dyrcona> Well, I do, but it's a "Grape" iMac sitting in the attic. The Mac Books are all in various states of dead.
2015-01-23T14:09:57  * Dyrcona isn't so sure the grape still works, either. It probably needs a new motherboard battery at least.
2015-01-23T14:14:07  <Dyrcona> Hmm.. Does a 6100 count? It actually has 72MB of RAM!
2015-01-23T14:15:20  <jboyer-isl> Dyrcona, Luxury!
2015-01-23T14:16:04  <Dyrcona> For 1992, it was luxury.

2015-01-23T14:17:02  <Dyrcona> It hasn't been used since 2002, and it last ran MkLinux.

2015-01-23T14:32:05  <tsbere> kmlussier: Er, I don't recall if cron jobs in general end up running on the VMs. Probably not. Running crontab <path to example crontab file> from the command line would fix it, though.
2015-01-23T14:33:24  <kmlussier> No, that's okay. I don't need to fix it. I'm just trying to figure out why I'm looking at the same patron record on 2 different VM's and saw that the fines accrued on one, but not the other.
2015-01-23T14:33:46  <kmlussier> The one that shows the fines was built yesterday, so an overnight cron job would explain it.
2015-01-23T14:34:12  <jboyer-isl> kmlussier, or certain circ activities, depending on what's been done with that account.
2015-01-23T14:35:24  <kmlussier> jboyer-isl: Maybe, but they're both using the Concerto dataset, so I suspect the circ activites should be the same for each.
2015-01-23T14:35:53  <tsbere> kmlussier: Huh, apparently I *did* rig the cronjobs to run. Go figure. Apparently you asked me to.
