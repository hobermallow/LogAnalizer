2015-01-29T09:47:42  <pinesol_green> Dyrcona: Boopsie caused the white screen of death!
2015-01-29T09:47:53  <Dyrcona> @blame LibraryBooks
2015-01-29T09:47:53  <pinesol_green> Dyrcona: everything was going great until LibraryBooks came along
2015-01-29T09:48:02  <Dyrcona> True dat, on the latter.
2015-01-29T09:48:54  <RoganH> We've had sales pitches for Boopsie several times.  It's had merit but it's seemed awkward to me.
2015-01-29T09:50:35  <Dyrcona> GET /eg/opac/myopac/circs HTTP/1.1" 200 39291 "-" "curl/7.22.0 for Boopsie, Inc."
2015-01-29T09:51:00  <jeff> i was disappointed when they switched to screen scraping, but somewhat understood their motivation.
2015-01-29T09:51:06  <Dyrcona> That's the URL that triggers lp 1415898
2015-01-29T09:51:06  <pinesol_green> Launchpad bug 1415898 in Evergreen 2.7 "OPAC Can Cause Proliferation of Connected CStore Drones" (affected: 1, heat: 6) [High,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1415898
2015-01-29T09:51:30  <Dyrcona> And, hey, several hundred hits from Boopsie in a couple of seconds.
2015-01-29T09:51:43  <jeff> eesh.
2015-01-29T09:51:45  <kmlussier> Several hundred hits?
2015-01-29T09:51:57  <jeff> i doubt that several hundred people fired up the app at the exact moment.
2015-01-29T09:51:58  <bshum> Ugh
2015-01-29T09:52:00  <kmlussier> So it's not a case of people looking up their account info while in the Boopsie app?
2015-01-29T09:52:06  <Dyrcona> Maybe I'm exaggerating, but a large number of hits in a few seconds.
2015-01-29T09:52:08  <bshum> UGH, I said.
2015-01-29T09:53:07  <Dyrcona> And something called LibraryBooks which is apparently an app for Android and IOS.

2015-01-29T10:02:38  *** yboston has joined #evergreen
2015-01-29T10:08:05  <Dyrcona> So before the fix above, we'd probably have between 140 and 200 cstore drones running.
2015-01-29T10:08:21  <Dyrcona> Right now, we have about 25.
2015-01-29T10:10:25  <collum> It looks like LibraryBooks is a nearly dead product.  https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/library-books/id365824503?mt=8
2015-01-29T10:11:20  <Dyrcona> Yes, but it still appears to be available in the app stores.
2015-01-29T10:11:27  <collum> tep
2015-01-29T10:11:33  <collum> yep, even.
2015-01-29T10:13:25  <berick> Dyrcona++
2015-01-29T10:15:42  <Dyrcona> Apparently, we have access logs going back to last February.
2015-01-29T10:16:34  <Dyrcona> The Boopsie user agent entries for the circ history show a steady increase to a peak in December when our problems began in earnest.
2015-01-29T10:17:03  <Dyrcona> Looks like this month will be the second highest, but they still have a couple of days to beat out December.
2015-01-29T10:17:32  <kmlussier> Have more libraries been signing up for Boopsie during that time period?
2015-01-29T10:17:41  <Dyrcona> LibraryBooks is a bit less even in the progression, but looks like December was their highest month, too.
2015-01-29T10:17:49  <eeevil> Dyrcona: does an hourly breakdown show peaks and valleys? I wonder if they just update registered users' data regularly and cache it
2015-01-29T10:18:10  <Dyrcona> kmlussier: They don't always tell me, 'cause they don't have to. Boopsie is more or less set up consortium wide.
2015-01-29T10:18:31  <Dyrcona> eeevil: tsbere is looking into that. So far he's just done a month by month break down.
2015-01-29T10:19:42  <Dyrcona> Could be just more people adopting these apps as well. Not necessarily more libraries signing up.
2015-01-29T10:20:02  <kmlussier> Yeah, that thought crossed my mind too.
2015-01-29T10:20:33  <Dyrcona> This makes me think I should revisit an old XML-RPC bug on Launchpad. Half of the code went in. The other half would make using XML-RPC with Evergreen a little more pleasant.
2015-01-29T10:21:21  <tsbere> If anyone wants to look at the "by hour" output: http://tomtrunk.mvlcstaff.org/boopsie_by_hour.txt and http://tomtrunk.mvlcstaff.org/librarybooks_by_hour.txt
2015-01-29T10:21:33  <Dyrcona> I was also wondering about the person who mentioned on the dev or general list that he was writing an app for his daughter.
2015-01-29T10:21:53  <Dyrcona> I know he was asking about backend calls, but he might have resorted to some screen scraping.
2015-01-29T10:22:08  <Dyrcona> I should email him to see if I can find out what his app does.
2015-01-29T10:22:35  <kmlussier> From his last email, it sounded like he was waiting until eeevil's code made it in. But that was a month or two ago.
2015-01-29T10:23:25  <kmlussier> I can't imagine that an app used by one person would be responsible for that many hits.
2015-01-29T10:24:21  <Dyrcona> You'd be surrpised what one app from one person could do....
2015-01-29T10:25:18  <Dyrcona> Put something in a loop or make a recursive call that doesn't end....

2015-01-29T10:31:43  <Dyrcona> See, there was a reason I split that into its own bug. :)
2015-01-29T10:32:12  <berick> nothing like a nice easy (*cough*) win
2015-01-29T10:33:52  <Dyrcona> yeah.
2015-01-29T10:34:04  <Dyrcona> Thought it fells like it took too long to find it.
2015-01-29T10:34:13  <Dyrcona> feels, even. ;)
2015-01-29T10:36:10  <berick> definitely
2015-01-29T10:36:42  <berick> it should have been more obvious in the logs
2015-01-29T11:00:24  <mmorgan> Has anyone had reports of problems with workstations losing customized receipt templates after upgrades?
2015-01-29T11:01:16  <Dyrcona> mmorgan: I don't think so, but we've had reports of them disappearing a few times.
2015-01-29T11:01:29  <Dyrcona> We always assumed someone deleted something by mistake.
2015-01-29T11:01:35  <mmorgan> Our recent upgrade to 2.7.2 went quite smoothly, except that several libraries reported losing their templates.
2015-01-29T11:01:49  <Dyrcona> mmorgan: Maybe they installed a new client along side the old one and didn't upgrade?
2015-01-29T11:02:36  <mmorgan> Dyrcona: I'm pretty sure they all followed the prompts in the self-updating client.
2015-01-29T11:02:37  <Dyrcona> I should really check the tickets before I say things from "memory." ;)
2015-01-29T11:03:24  <mmorgan> Even if they did install a new version of the client, shouldn't the receipt templates persist?
2015-01-29T11:05:03  <Dyrcona> Depends on how your client is setup to store them, I think.
2015-01-29T11:05:16  <Dyrcona> There's an option to store the data in the program directory.
2015-01-29T11:05:26  <Dyrcona> Otherwise, it goes in the user's profile.
2015-01-29T11:05:51  <mmorgan> For us it's in the user's profile. I wasn't aware it was an option.
2015-01-29T11:06:25  <Dyrcona> Maybe they have more than one profile or more than one user on the PCs.
2015-01-29T11:07:09  <Dyrcona> Some of our libraries have multiple user account on workstations, so we have the information stored in the program directory, IIRC.
2015-01-29T11:08:11  <mmorgan> I think for some libraries, there are multiple user profiles, but not for the majority of our users.
2015-01-29T11:08:57  <mmorgan> To add to the disruption, when they tried to import their saved templates, the import failed with a File Import error:
2015-01-29T11:09:04  <mmorgan> 	"fileName":"oils://remote/js/dojo/dojo/dojo.js",
2015-01-29T11:09:04  <mmorgan> 	"lineNumber":24
2015-01-29T11:12:17  <Dyrcona> Not seen that one before. It sounds like the client or profile may have been corrupted.
2015-01-29T11:12:51  <Dyrcona> We usually tell folk to do a full install of the client when they get things like that, and it usually fixes the issue.
2015-01-29T11:14:45  <mmorgan> One library sent me their template file, and I get the same error. I was assuming a problem with the file, but I'll try reinstalling my client.
2015-01-29T11:19:08  <mmorgan> Hmm, new client, same error :-( Guess I'll wade through the template file a bit.
2015-01-29T11:31:14  <Dyrcona> Yeah, in that case, it sounds like the template file.

2015-01-29T12:00:40  <jeff> mmorgan: does the template file work in the previous version of the client? i don't remember offhand how tricky that might be in your environment to test.
2015-01-29T12:01:08  <jeff> (i'm wondering if there was a change that broke import of previous-version receipt templates, either in some or all circumstances)
2015-01-29T12:02:17  *** bmills has joined #evergreen
2015-01-29T12:04:14  <mmorgan> jeff: Hmm. That's a thought. I'll see if I can find an older client to test it on.
2015-01-29T12:05:20  <kmlussier> mmorgan: I could try it in a 2.5 client
2015-01-29T12:05:28  <jeff> could also explain why the new client failed to load the stored templates from disk.
2015-01-29T12:06:03  <jeff> if you find signs that seem to confirm that theory, the template file that broke could be useful -- especially if it's "only under certain circumstances" kind of thing.
2015-01-29T12:07:33  * mmorgan needs more coffee. Found the older client, but no server to connect to anymore;-)
2015-01-29T12:08:35  <mmorgan> kmlussier: I think I'll take you up on your offer. Can I send you a file to try?
2015-01-29T12:08:44  <kmlussier> mmorgan: Sure!
2015-01-29T12:09:28  <mmorgan> ok, will send it via email.
2015-01-29T12:14:39  <kmlussier> mmorgan: They imported fine in the 2.5 client
2015-01-29T12:14:54  <mmorgan> Hmm. Interesting!
2015-01-29T12:15:56  <kmlussier> Or I should say, it imported fine. One file.
2015-01-29T12:16:41  <kmlussier> So did something change with receipt templates in 2.7?
2015-01-29T12:16:41  <mmorgan> So we have some standard copy and paste code for some templates.
2015-01-29T12:17:13  <mmorgan> I just pasted that in my 2.7 client and it saved fine.

2015-01-29T12:20:53  <mmorgan> I think the problem in our recommended hold_slip footer.
2015-01-29T12:21:02  *** Stompro has quit IRC
2015-01-29T12:22:41  <mmorgan> http://paste.evergreen-ils.org/28
2015-01-29T12:23:31  <mmorgan> kmlussier: Do you see that in the hold_slip footer in your 2.5 client?
2015-01-29T12:23:52  <tsbere> mmorgan: The problem is likely more in the background, how it is stored (locally or otherwise) - There is a bad char in there somewhere
2015-01-29T12:24:24  <mmorgan> tsbere: Yes, a bad char that's only a problem since 2.7
2015-01-29T12:24:40  <tsbere> (also, &nbsp; < Note the ; on the end, your paste doesn't seem to have it on the two)
2015-01-29T12:25:10  <kmlussier> mmorgan: Yes
2015-01-29T12:26:28  <eeevil> hrm... are those files supposed to be JSON to the client?
2015-01-29T12:26:28  <tsbere> mmorgan: I don't know if you have funky overrides in place or not, but you may want to look at print_list_templates in your profile or install directory (per-machine storage would be install, per-user would be the profile folder) - That may have an issue. Removing it (rename, perhaps) would revert you back to defaults.
2015-01-29T12:26:47  <tsbere> eeevil: print_list_templates is a json object
2015-01-29T12:27:20  <eeevil> if so, you may be able to just excise the entities (the '&...;' strings)
2015-01-29T12:30:06  <mmorgan> The problem is definitely in that footer. As soon as I save that in a template, then login again, I get the error and the templates revert to default. Luckily there aren't too many characters there to examine :)
2015-01-29T12:35:46  <tsbere> mmorgan: I would check the &nbsp vs &nbsp; part at least (note: You may not need those at all before the <br/> anyway)
2015-01-29T12:36:41  <mmorgan> Found the problem. That row of dashes at the bottom of the footer ended up being saved as: ^T^T^T^T^T^T^T^T^T in the file. Once I took that out of the file, it imported fine.
2015-01-29T12:37:54  <mmorgan> I can fix the source our libraries are using, but it's odd that it's suddenly is broken in 2.7.
2015-01-29T12:37:59  *** buzzy has quit IRC
2015-01-29T12:38:06  <tsbere> Oh, those are the funky dashes from word or something. Replacing them with - (or just putting a <hr/> in) would probably work.
2015-01-29T12:38:27  <kmlussier> mmorgan: I don't think I pasted the row of dashed when I tried replicating the problem. :)
2015-01-29T12:39:10  <mmorgan> I can paste that code in and save it. It works for the session, but logout and in again, and the templates revert to default.
2015-01-29T12:39:46  <tsbere> mmorgan: I blame a word processor being used at some point. As I said, replace them with a regular - or just remove the row and put a <hr/> in ;)
2015-01-29T12:40:07  <tsbere> The latter should also adjust properly to whatever width is needed
2015-01-29T12:41:17  <mmorgan> tsbere: am planning to do just that :)
2015-01-29T12:41:21  <kmlussier> mmorgan: And I don't see them in the receipt I imported on the 2.5 client I was using. So I lied when I said everything was displaying in the holds slip footer.
2015-01-29T12:42:24  <mmorgan> ok, thanks.
2015-01-29T12:44:52  <mmorgan> I can fix things now for our libraries going forward, the extraneous characters shouldn't have been there in the first place. Too bad we ran into this. Aside from that it would have been a flawless upgrade!

2015-01-29T12:49:24  <Dyrcona> Having correlated some of their hourly activity with times that we have crashes shows that we typically have a higher level of Boopsie activity in the logs in the hours leading up to a crash situation.

2015-01-29T16:03:50  <Dyrcona> yboston: Total number of items out?
2015-01-29T16:04:04  <Dyrcona> Or total number of a certain kind of item out?
2015-01-29T16:04:14  <yboston> I guess both
2015-01-29T16:04:27  <yboston> are there two place for each?

2015-01-29T16:05:08  <Dyrcona> Limits sets matches up with circ matrix and can limit certain items, like DVDs.
2015-01-29T16:05:19  <Dyrcona> There is another setting for total items out.
2015-01-29T16:05:58  <yboston> whcih is that other setting?
2015-01-29T16:05:58  <Dyrcona> I'm looking for it, but had to login again. My session expired.
2015-01-29T16:06:10  <yboston> thank you very much, this is very helpful

2015-01-29T16:24:34  <RoganH_> Quick question - does anyone know off the top of their head if last activity includes SIP activity?
2015-01-29T16:24:43  <RoganH_> (I can go test it of course but feeling lazy.)

2015-01-29T16:31:37  <kmlussier> I should know the answer to that question.
2015-01-29T16:32:33  <mmorgan> There are sip2 activity types. One for login and one for verify
2015-01-29T16:36:34  <jeff> and I think only "verify" is used by current code.
2015-01-29T16:37:36  <jeff> oh, and RoganH_ is gone anyway.
2015-01-29T16:47:52  <eeevil> @later tell RhoganH_ it doesn't yet, but I've a branch...
2015-01-29T16:47:52  <pinesol_green> eeevil: The operation succeeded.

2015-01-29T17:38:52  <csharp> kmlussier: you mean the progress indicator bars?
2015-01-29T18:07:37  <kmlussier> csharp: It doesn't appear to be a progress indicator. Actually, I've answered my own question. It lets you know if you're connected to the network, and I'm guessing the other indicator lets you know if you're connected to hatch.
2015-01-29T18:08:51  <kmlussier> But it gets in the way. There is now an option to collapse it when it blocks something from view, but I suspect it's going to ultimately annoy users. I'm just wondering if it's necessary.
2015-01-29T18:28:48  <berick> kmlussier: right, network and hatch.  IIRC, eeevil added a way to hide it
2015-01-29T18:29:03  <berick> i'd be in favor of hiding it by default, and maybe completely changing it
2015-01-29T18:29:08  <berick> it does tend to get in the way
2015-01-29T18:32:27  <berick> oh, heh, i see you noticed the hiding part
