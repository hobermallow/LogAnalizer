2015-01-30T10:37:05  <goood> berick: remind me, streaming responses should work fine over websockets, and trigger the promise's third .then() function on each response, and the first on respond_complete. yes?
2015-01-30T10:38:23  <berick> goood: yes, exactly
2015-01-30T10:38:40  <goood> that's what I though
2015-01-30T10:38:55  <goood> and what seems to be intended on the clear hold shelf UI
2015-01-30T10:39:19  <goood> but, it doesn't seem to be updating on each clear...
2015-01-30T10:39:59  <berick> i think the clear shelf API responds after every X updates
2015-01-30T10:40:37  <berick> looks like $chunk_size = 25
2015-01-30T10:42:34  <goood> so an impatient user might not see the UI change, and hit refresh to see what's going on
2015-01-30T10:43:05  <berick> potentially, yes.  in the land of websockets, we could significantly reduce the chunk_size
2015-01-30T10:43:16  <berick> since that's mostly there to work around bugs in the old multipart/mixed-replace stuff
2015-01-30T10:43:29  <goood> got it. well, a param can be passed, maybe
2015-01-30T10:43:34  <berick> yeah
2015-01-30T10:44:03  <goood> hrm, not currently
2015-01-30T10:47:10  <goood> ok, adding, and using chunk size = 1
2015-01-30T10:48:02  <berick> oh and recall opensrf does some chunking, too.
2015-01-30T10:52:59  <csharp> dbs: did you end up actually installing an older SIPServer to resolve your issues?
2015-01-30T10:54:07  * csharp is seeing high RAM on PINES' sip servers and was assuming the fixes for bug 1339190 would help resolve it, but doesn't want to bring on a world of hurt
2015-01-30T10:54:07  <pinesol_green> Launchpad bug 1339190 in SIPServer "SIPServer is heavy, not my brother" (affected: 3, heat: 14) [Undecided,Fix committed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1339190
2015-01-30T10:54:34  <csharp> oh, and we're using a SIPServer of an early 2013 vintage
2015-01-30T11:00:16  <jeff> do you have time/resources to run a new SIPServer on an alternate host or alternate port, and test with a small group of SIP clients, adding or removing from the test if/as you run into trouble?
2015-01-30T11:00:38  <jeff> i know you'd hate to be too much of a test bed...
2015-01-30T11:00:54  <csharp> hmm - that's a thought
2015-01-30T11:01:52  <csharp> our testing process is actually asking libraries to connect their devices/third-party services to whichever testing cluster we've set up for the purpose
2015-01-30T11:01:55  <jeff> but there are certainly benefits for you (and all) in having the gains of things like the work in that bug, so identifying any new issues would clear the path...
2015-01-30T11:02:15  <Dyrcona> Looks like we're not running that fix, yet.
2015-01-30T11:02:30  <csharp> but it would answer most of our questions to throw in an upgraded sip server for a day and record what happens
2015-01-30T11:02:47  <csharp> and VMs are cheap ;-)
2015-01-30T11:04:19  <goood> berick: luckily, we can dynamically set the max_chunk_size for a method ... I'll set that to $chunk_size
2015-01-30T11:04:34  <berick> goood: oh yeah, forgot about that
2015-01-30T11:04:36  <berick> cool
2015-01-30T11:06:09  <goood> csharp: we're using only SipServer master in production, and with the multiplex personality. it's working really well for us.  One note is you may want to increase the worker-timeout (see SipServer example config) if you have sorters and such, as that will allow that connection's worker to stick around and not incur the worker startup cost

2015-01-30T11:18:12  <kmlussier> Hmmm...mmorgan had a problem on webby a few months ago where she was prompted for a login every time she tried to edit a patron record. Nobody locally was able to replicate it at the time, but it's happening to me now too.
2015-01-30T11:18:36  <kmlussier> I thought it might be one of those problems that could be fixed by registering a workstation, but I'm working with a registered workstation now and still see the problem.

2015-01-30T11:38:16  <goood> I'm not having that issue. just tested with admin
2015-01-30T11:38:48  <jboyer-isl> csharp, There's no news like old news, but I thought I'd pass along that we've been running SIPServer master as of roughly christmas time with Multiplex and it's been good. (I did have to bring back the nightly service restarts, but that's not that big a deal.)
2015-01-30T11:39:20  <jeff> jboyer-isl: what made you bring back the nightly service restarts?
2015-01-30T11:40:08  <jeff> jboyer-isl: and do you mean just SIPServer, or restarting OpenSRF services on the SIP host also?
2015-01-30T11:40:43  <jboyer-isl> Even with Multiplex our process count would eventually top out. I don't know if that's a difference between the 2 personalities or if I'm missing a config option. We had to restart them nightly on 2.2 (and build a custom script to trim a single location's connections)
2015-01-30T11:40:49  <kmlussier> goood: I'm not surprised. I never saw that issue when mmorgan first reported it, but it happened consistently every time she tried to edit a patron record. I think today is the 1st time I tried editing a patron account since I got my new laptop.
2015-01-30T11:40:59  <kmlussier> It's happening both in Firefox and Chrome for me. :(
2015-01-30T11:41:05  <jboyer-isl> and then on 2.5 our numbers stayed steady/low all the time.
2015-01-30T11:41:38  <jboyer-isl> jeff: I mean SIPServer specifically, we'd have the max number of SIPServer processes waiting on connections that weren't coming back.
2015-01-30T11:42:12  <goood> kmlussier: would you mind trying it in an "private browsing" window? (have to close all private windows first -- they share a sandbox) I've seen issues in both FF and chrome where more is cached than should be...
2015-01-30T11:42:19  <jboyer-isl> Something about SIPServer circa Feb 2013 was different, but I haven't had time to focus on it since the nightly restarts keep everything happy.

2015-01-30T12:15:40  <csharp> btw, we've *always* done nightly SIPServer restarts and I use that administratively in that when people need new SIP accounts, I tell them that it "activates" overnight (due to the restart)
2015-01-30T12:16:38  <csharp> of course if we got ldirector/lvs working with sip servers, we could roll them in and out

2015-01-30T12:20:18  <Dyrcona> csharp jboyer-isl You're probably having issues with the timeout code that disconnects idle clients.
2015-01-30T12:21:15  <jboyer-isl> I suspect so. I thought that a check_for_dead Net::Server param made a difference, but I may have been mistaken.
2015-01-30T12:22:56  <Dyrcona> It was implemented 'cause we've seen at least one client that makes a new connection for transactions, but leaves the old ones connected.
2015-01-30T12:23:19  <Dyrcona> After a while, it's hogging all of the available servers.

2015-01-30T14:50:33  <Stompro> Has anyone used relayd for load balancing your servers.  Is it too simplistic?
2015-01-30T14:55:53  <bshum> Stompro: I have not, for our use, we've only used ldirector.  I think some folks at ESI and Mobius have used Pound proxy too.
2015-01-30T14:56:02  <bshum> Others may have further experience to share.
2015-01-30T15:13:14  <Stompro> Our firewall (pfsense) has relayd and haproxy built in, so I would like to try and use one of those to keep things simple.
