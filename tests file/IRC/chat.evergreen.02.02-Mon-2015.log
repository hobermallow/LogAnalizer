2015-02-02T20:34:52  <Dyrcona> AFAIK, only Library Elf uses XML-RPC.
2015-02-02T20:36:01  <Dyrcona> Crazy. I see them posting without the the dash in the URL.
2015-02-02T20:36:12  <Dyrcona> Grr. I meant with the dash.

2015-02-02T21:05:35  <Dyrcona> Looking at the code for unwrap_perl in XMLRPCGateway, again, and I don't even see how you could possibly pass a Fieldmapper object into that without lots of client side magic.
2015-02-02T21:06:13  <Dyrcona> I'm trying to add the ability to use the structs that XMLRPCGateway returns without having to use Fieldmapper on the client.
2015-02-02T21:06:41  <Dyrcona> I had a branch, since deleted, that did this, but IIRC, it broke anyone who might currently have this working correctly.
2015-02-02T21:06:55  <Dyrcona> I'm trying not to break things for existing users.
2015-02-02T21:07:26  <Dyrcona> That's always the hardest part of this sort of thing.
2015-02-02T21:32:18  <Dyrcona> Actually, I can't even figure out how you would call an update method using the current code....
2015-02-02T21:32:32  <Dyrcona> Just trying to change the case in my own name isn't work.
2015-02-02T21:32:44  <Dyrcona> working....
2015-02-02T21:37:37  <Dyrcona> I also think unwrap_perl suffers from extra recursion.
2015-02-02T21:59:43  <Dyrcona> Ah, crazy.
2015-02-02T22:00:29  <Dyrcona> Apparently, I am making it into the open-ils.actor.patron.update method, but it is blowing up on addresses.
2015-02-02T22:00:46  <Dyrcona> I didn't flesh addresses, 'cause I just wanted to change the name for a test.
2015-02-02T22:05:38  <Dyrcona> Interesting. It's blowing up on the user object that it pulled from the database and not the one that I passed in via XML-RPC.
2015-02-02T22:08:39  <Dyrcona> Also, unwrap_perl seems to be making a proper Fielmapper::actor:_user object from what I am giving it via XML-RPC.
2015-02-02T22:08:57  <Dyrcona> Not as neat as taking what the server gives me, modifying that, and handing it back.
