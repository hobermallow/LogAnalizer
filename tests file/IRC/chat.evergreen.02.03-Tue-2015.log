2015-02-03T10:38:26  <rjackson_isl> appear to be running into bug 1091885 where a bib record is undeleted and there is no entry in metabib.record_attr
2015-02-03T10:38:26  <pinesol_green> Launchpad bug 1091885 in Evergreen "Reingest bib needs to deal with missing metabib.record_attr entries" (affected: 2, heat: 12) [Medium,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1091885
2015-02-03T10:38:38  <bshum> Yeah that'll happen
2015-02-03T10:38:46  <rjackson_isl> before upgrading to 2.7.2 the entry was a table
2015-02-03T10:39:09  <rjackson_isl> but now it is a view and table related is metabib.record_attr_vector_list I think
2015-02-03T10:39:30  <rjackson_isl> how do we repopulate so undeleted bib can be searched again?
2015-02-03T10:40:53  <bshum> rjackson_isl: Presumably the same basic idea ought to work I think.
2015-02-03T10:41:09  <bshum> Insert an entry with anything in it.  Then reingest the bib record
2015-02-03T10:41:14  <bshum> To create the actual values
2015-02-03T10:41:33  <rjackson_isl> the table has a vlist column type integer[] not null??
2015-02-03T10:42:08  <rjackson_isl> just dump anything in that column that satisifies the type?
2015-02-03T10:42:24  <bshum> rjackson_isl: Pretty much what I would try first, yeah.
2015-02-03T10:42:34  <rjackson_isl> bshum++ will do
2015-02-03T10:43:40  <bshum> If that does work, then I would update your findings with the new MVF/CRA framework from 2.6+ in mind for that bug.
2015-02-03T10:44:08  <bshum> The bug was reported much earlier, before changes to metabib.record_attr happened during the 2.6 era.
2015-02-03T10:44:18  <bshum> Undeleted bib records are just plain messy :)

2015-02-03T12:08:25  <RoganH> Here's a quick question, what, historically, was the intended difference between circulating library and owning library in the asset.copy table?
2015-02-03T12:09:34  <bshum> RoganH: I think owning library is actually on the asset.call_number table?
2015-02-03T12:10:10  <RoganH> Oh, you're right it is.
2015-02-03T12:10:16  * bshum has guesses on the rest of that, but will let some original devs talk about original intents
2015-02-03T12:10:21  <RoganH> In my head (I was in the staff client) they were mashed together.
2015-02-03T12:10:57  <berick> library A owns the copy, but it lives temporarily at library B (circ lib)
2015-02-03T12:10:57  <bshum> My assumption was that it allowed an item to be owned by one library, but then circulated elsewhere.  And when returned it would go to whichever circ lib it lived at.
2015-02-03T12:11:33  <RoganH> berick: that's what I was assuming but it's good to know
2015-02-03T12:20:39  *** mnsri_away is now known as mnsri
2015-02-03T12:22:32  <dbwells> re: circ vs owning lib, I understand how it works in practice, but I don't think I've ever really understood the design.  Is it just a matter of convenience that owning_lib is on the call_number?  That there tend to be fewer owners than circ-ers, so this was a handy way to group them for permissions, etc.?
2015-02-03T12:25:27  <dbs> I think the idea was also that systems could "own" call numbers, to prevent dupes of non-deleted call numbers, and just distribute copies amongst their branches.
2015-02-03T12:27:30  <mmorgan> Anybody have experience using a different owning vs. circ library in practice?
2015-02-03T12:28:00  <berick> what dbs said...  a call number was basically defined from the beginning as a label + a location (org unit).
2015-02-03T12:31:15  *** buzzy has quit IRC
2015-02-03T12:31:56  <bshum> mmorgan: In most cases, it's the same for our libs.  The only time it really differs is during summer reading months where school libs sometimes transfer copies over to the public libs in their towns for broader use.
2015-02-03T12:32:20  <bshum> That'd be a case where the school lib was owning lib, but the copy was changed to have the local town lib as the circ lib.
2015-02-03T12:32:46  <bshum> Other than that, I don't think we have too many other use cases where those differ.
2015-02-03T12:32:53  <dbwells> I guess the odd thing for me with that definition is that the label is owned by a location, but depending on the circ lib, isn't necessarily /at/ that location.  I find that confusing, but maybe it's just me.
2015-02-03T12:32:56  <bshum> Even with our branch libs, they all tend to keep things separated.
2015-02-03T12:34:12  <RoganH> We've kept things separated as well but we're starting to rethink things.  As we've looked more at floating type behaviors there are things that are presenting difficulties and some bad practices that have gone unnoticed for a long time biting us in the rear.
2015-02-03T12:34:32  <RoganH> I've found I've had to step back and think about how to make this a bit cleaner and some perspective about intent is useful.

2015-02-03T12:43:16  <dbs> dbwells: an entry in the OU hierarchy isn't necessarily a location, but instead can just be an organization

2015-02-03T13:05:44  <dbwells> mmorgan: We tried having them different with a collection which was changing ownership (aka management), but not location.  One issue we ran into is that Holdings Maintenance is scoped by Owning Library, and this caused great confusion for staff who were used to thinking of it as a location-based tree.
2015-02-03T13:05:59  <krvmga> so 1#000, 1%000, 1&000, 1*000, 1 000 and so on all work

2015-02-03T15:12:26  <Dyrcona> Funny how everyone calls them macros, when more often than you not, you end up writing full-blown programs in elisp.
2015-02-03T15:12:26  <Dyrcona> Back to what I was talking about at around 10:00 to 10:30 PM EST yesterday.....
2015-02-03T15:12:50  <Dyrcona> I checked that open-ils.actor.patron.update works when called normally on my development vm, so nothing I loaded broke it.
2015-02-03T15:13:35  <Dyrcona> I also get the same error against my production machine as I do on development, and the line in question is looking up data in the user that it supposedly pulled from the database.
2015-02-03T15:14:06  <Dyrcona> I used the same IDL to create my actor user object as we use on the respective servers, so I don't think fields are out of sync.
2015-02-03T15:14:36  <Dyrcona> I *may* actually dig into this with the debugger, but probably not on MVLC's time.
2015-02-03T15:14:58  <Dyrcona> I just wanted to make sure nothing in master or a dev branch I loaded had broken open-ils.actor.

2015-02-03T15:30:24  <Dyrcona> 2.7.1 requires a mra ingest, doesn't it?

2015-02-03T15:35:22  <dbwells> My understanding is that coming from 2.6.3, you will now be alright.
2015-02-03T15:35:32  <dbwells> But I didn't actually look into it.
2015-02-03T15:35:52  <bshum> dbwells: I think we put a note to run the 2.6.3 script if it was missed along the way (since it retroactively didn't break anything to run it after getting to 2.7 either)
2015-02-03T15:38:14  <bshum> That particular script and bug entries did not include an instruction to reingest
2015-02-03T15:38:39  <dbwells> You're right, but I think it probably should have, if I understand it.
2015-02-03T15:38:41  <bshum> If we should reingest, then we could add an instruction to do that somewhere... sigh.
2015-02-03T15:40:22  <dbwells> My feelings exactly.  If a reingest is needed, that upgrade script should at least spit out the "hey, you need to reingest now, here's a way" message.
