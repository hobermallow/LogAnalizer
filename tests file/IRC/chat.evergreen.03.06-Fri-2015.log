2015-03-06T09:31:58  <csharp> so in my prep for my (proposed) EG2015 session on server logging, I'm interested whether anyone has gotten Evergreen logging via systemd/journalctl since that's what's coming down the road for mainstream distros
2015-03-06T09:32:38  <csharp> has anyone given thought and/or experimentation towards that?
2015-03-06T09:32:54  <bshum> csharp: I finally left syslog-ng server behind last year when our log server inexplicably exploded.
2015-03-06T09:33:08  <bshum> And I had to build a new one using rsyslog.
2015-03-06T09:33:14  <bshum> So.... no, not from me.
2015-03-06T09:33:14  <bshum> :)

2015-03-06T09:52:43  * graced is all ears
2015-03-06T09:53:43  <remingtron> graced: when should we start telling people to post individual web client bugs to launchpad?
2015-03-06T09:54:12  <remingtron> can they start now? or is ESI still working through their own list?
2015-03-06T09:54:30  <graced> remingtron: we have resolved all but a few (less than 10 I think) bugs that were reported initially.
2015-03-06T09:54:56  <graced> So, we'll release that WHOLE list next week with the reports and resolutions so people can cross check their bugs?
2015-03-06T09:55:17  <graced> And as we've been fixing we've been updating webby, of course
2015-03-06T09:55:38  <remingtron> do you expect to release the remaining ones as launchpad bugs, or some other published list?
2015-03-06T09:56:25  <yboston> Heads up, I will be stepping away from my desk from 10 AM EST to about 11 AM EST; feel free to use the Google Hangout without me there
2015-03-06T09:56:25  <graced> We plan to resolve all the bugs but there are a few that we will be moving to LP to get some assistance/sanity checking from a larger group
2015-03-06T09:57:30  <graced> So, the resolved ones won't be duplicated on LP, we'll just release the spreadsheet showing the reported bugs and the resolution
2015-03-06T09:57:49  <remingtron> right, sounds good.
2015-03-06T09:57:55  <graced> We do have a different plan for bug reporting for Sprint #2... so hopefully this will be less... complicated
2015-03-06T09:58:11  <graced> Well, I should say we're looking at several different plans. we haven't settled yet.
2015-03-06T09:58:31  <graced> Regardless, I think they're all better than round 1
2015-03-06T09:58:43  <remingtron> improvement is good!

Since ESI is very near completion on their bug list, I will leave that commit as it is, since there is very little chance of duplicate bugs being reported before you publish your list next week.
2015-03-06T10:03:57  <pinesol_green> remingtron: The operation succeeded.

2015-03-06T10:50:06  <remingtron> I'm documenting the new 2.8 ability to delete copy locations, and wanted to add info about other common copy-location-editor actions. Anyone have comments?
2015-03-06T10:50:53  <remingtron> OPAC visible, holdable, checkin alert, etc.?
2015-03-06T10:51:19  <remingtron> (and how to explain them in 1 line)
2015-03-06T10:52:37  <mmorgan> I'll give it a try for some...
2015-03-06T10:52:43  <mmorgan> Checkin Alert with provide an alert at checkin that the item needs to be routed to that location.
2015-03-06T10:53:20  <mmorgan> Holdable set to false will make all copies in that location NOT holdable regardless of other settings.
2015-03-06T10:54:00  <mmorgan> OPAC Visible set to false will hide all copies in that location from the public OPAC
2015-03-06T10:55:05  <jeff> Last I looked, the checkin alert is limited to only interfaces (such as the staff client) that maintain a list of shelving locations with alert messages and pop up the message accordingly. There is no checkin event thrown, it is not a "do you want to override this?" kind of action, and there is zero effect on things like SIP checkins. I should go verify all that to ensure that it's still that way.
2015-03-06T10:55:39  <jeff> Holdable set to false at the shelving location level has some interesting interactions with staff-placed copy level holds, I think.
2015-03-06T10:55:42  <remingtron> mmorgan++ #thanks for the help!
2015-03-06T10:56:35  <remingtron> jeff++ #thanks for the detailed perspective
2015-03-06T10:57:34  <jeff> Somewhere it's worth documenting if it isn't documented yet (or documenting in multiple locations) that certain things like "opac visible" exist as both shelving location and item attributes. Any "no" trumps.
2015-03-06T10:57:49  <mmorgan> Hold verify, I can't quite remember how that works. Looked at it a bit ago. I *think* if set to true, it pops up an alert for items in that location at capture time saying "Hold capture delayed".
2015-03-06T10:58:03  <mmorgan> jeff++ excellent point!
2015-03-06T10:59:38  <jeff> Hold Capture Verify in the staff client means that if an item is being checked in and would normally capture for a hold, staff receive a message (possibly paraphrasing:) "this item could be captured for a hold but has been prevented by policy" with a prompt to capture the item or not.
2015-03-06T11:00:29  <jeff> The original use case was to prevent immediate availability of AV materials that had been checked in but had not yet been "inspected" for damage / missing discs / cleaning.
2015-03-06T11:01:27  <jeff> That's one of those things where we needed the functionality, we funded the development, and now we no longer need the functionality (we did use the feature for many years). I do not know if anyone else uses it, or what their use case is if different from ours.
2015-03-06T11:08:19  *** vlewis has joined #evergreen
2015-03-06T11:08:55  <jboyer-isl> I think the message confuses staff. "prevented by policy" sounds like you can't have it, not that it has been delayed for some other purpose with the intent of allowing it later.
2015-03-06T11:09:14  <mmorgan> remingtron++
2015-03-06T11:23:43  <jeff> jboyer-isl: yep. "delayed because it is in the shelving location FOO, whose configuration prevents automatic hold capture" or something might be better. :-)
2015-03-06T11:24:55  <jeff> or just "because its shelving location is configured to prevent automatic hold capture"
2015-03-06T11:26:41  <jboyer-isl> That one is pretty good. I wasn't necessarily arguing to have it changed, but the only time it's ever come up here is when someone checks a box to see what it does and then the circ staff start asking questions. :)

2015-03-06T12:39:46  <gmcharlt> FOLKS, your periodic reminder that 2.5 will be desupported upon release of 2.8.0! :)
2015-03-06T12:43:51  <Dyrcona> Err. 2.5 is already unsupported and 2.5.9 was only done, 'cause the security release process started before March 1.
2015-03-06T12:47:31  <kmlussier> I don't think the policy was ever moved to the web site. I think it's in some long-ago email to the general and dev lists.

2015-03-06T12:52:27  <dbs> http://wiki.evergreen-ils.org/doku.php?id=release_schedule - nothing else in the wiki links to the page. heh

2015-03-06T14:15:50  <Dyrcona> *Should* is one thing. *Does* is another. :)
2015-03-06T14:16:12  <Dyrcona> I have a hunch things are just done out of order.
2015-03-06T14:16:30  <Dyrcona> Since I'm not messing with message center. I won't worry about it today.
2015-03-06T14:16:35  <eady> Well, yes.
2015-03-06T14:17:07  <berick> huh, actor.usr_note has a default create_date, but it's NULLable
2015-03-06T14:17:27  <berick> guessing you have a usr_note w/ a NULL create_date
2015-03-06T14:17:42  <berick> may need a coalesce in the upgrade
2015-03-06T14:18:10  <jonadab> Upgrades are so much fun.  Why don't people do them more often?  ;-)
2015-03-06T14:18:12  <Dyrcona> Or, maybe a nullable column? Since who knows when the note was created.
2015-03-06T14:18:15  <kmlussier> Huh. What would cause a user note not to have a create date?
2015-03-06T14:18:33  <berick> kmlussier: i'm guessing through non-standard means
2015-03-06T14:18:34  <Dyrcona> jonadab: I do them quite often ion my development server.
2015-03-06T14:18:43  <berick> like, a manual insert or a migration or some such
2015-03-06T14:18:48  <Dyrcona> You might say, that's what this was. :)
2015-03-06T14:18:48  <dbs> non-null prevents non-standard data :)
2015-03-06T14:18:51  <jonadab> Dyrcona: Ah, yes.
2015-03-06T14:19:06  <Dyrcona> dbs: Where's the fun in that? ;)
2015-03-06T14:19:29  <dbs> If we wanted fun, we would have used mysql
2015-03-06T14:19:38  <jonadab> Heh.
2015-03-06T14:19:47  <berick> heh, indeed
2015-03-06T14:19:55  <Dyrcona> SQLite....or BerkeleyDB.
2015-03-06T14:20:08  <Dyrcona> GDBM, anyone?
2015-03-06T14:20:12  <jonadab> I actually use MySQL for a lot of stuff.  But I wholeheartedly endorse the choice of Postgres for an ILS.
2015-03-06T14:20:14  <Dyrcona> No takers?
2015-03-06T14:20:24  <dbs> MARC::Charset took GDBM didn't it?
2015-03-06T14:20:26  <Dyrcona> jonadab: Ditto.
2015-03-06T14:20:37  * berick likes sqlite.. for other stuff ;)
2015-03-06T14:20:38  <dbs> me too, but not by choice :)
2015-03-06T14:20:51  <Dyrcona> But really the 0911 error bothers me more, since 0910 is my data's fault. :)
2015-03-06T14:21:09  <jeff> dbs: yes, which makes MARC::Charset fail on perl that was compiled without a system having libgdbm :-)
2015-03-06T14:21:12  <berick> Dyrcona: 0911 fails because 0910 did
2015-03-06T14:21:16  <Dyrcona> I've used hsqldb for some Java stuff.
2015-03-06T14:21:25  <Dyrcona> berick: OK, then.
2015-03-06T14:22:02  <Dyrcona> Anyway... I'll fix that after I mangle some biblio record entry buckets.

2015-03-06T14:33:28  <jonadab> SQLite is much better than rolling your own black-box DB-in-a-file format.
2015-03-06T14:33:42  <jonadab> Which I have seen people do.

2015-03-06T14:36:16  <yboston> dbs: gracias
2015-03-06T14:36:23  <Dyrcona> I think it was something related to Evergreen, too, some kind of clean up project.
2015-03-06T14:38:28  <Dyrcona> Well, looks like I did something right today.
2015-03-06T14:39:31  <Dyrcona> berick: I think I'm just going to set some arbitrary date on my null usr_notes, like 2011-05-30 at midnight.
2015-03-06T14:39:40  <Dyrcona> That's roughly the time of our migration.
2015-03-06T14:39:52  <berick> Dyrcona: you confirmed some exist?
2015-03-06T14:39:58  <berick> w/ null dates, that is
2015-03-06T14:40:02  <Dyrcona> Well, no. I'm just guessing.
2015-03-06T14:40:24  <berick> i only ask because i'm mostly guessing too
2015-03-06T14:40:37  <berick> i mean, it seems like the likely cause
2015-03-06T14:41:10  <Dyrcona> OK. I've confirmed...
2015-03-06T14:41:20  <berick> cool, thanks for checking
2015-03-06T14:41:31  <Dyrcona> You wouldn't believe me if I told you: 24,121.
2015-03-06T14:41:46  <Dyrcona> Must be a migration thing.
2015-03-06T14:41:50  <berick> yeah..
2015-03-06T14:41:53  <Dyrcona> Our people love notes.
2015-03-06T14:42:37  <Dyrcona> Well, that's not so bad. 169,830 are not null.
2015-03-06T14:44:29  <Dyrcona> And, 0910 works now. I'll run 0911 next.
2015-03-06T14:44:56  <Dyrcona> And it works.
2015-03-06T14:45:04  <Dyrcona> I'll just do that update in production, too.
2015-03-06T14:45:18  <Dyrcona> I mean for the null dates
2015-03-06T14:46:12  <jeff> unless you can tie them to a migration-related date, i think i'd go with setting the note create_date to match the user create_date
2015-03-06T14:47:40  <Dyrcona> Too late.
2015-03-06T14:48:09  <Dyrcona> Migration date just seemed to make sense, and it may be better than null.
2015-03-06T14:48:21  * Dyrcona has mixed thoughts on null.
2015-03-06T14:48:46  <kmlussier> Is that a potential gotcha for other sites that should be covered in an upgrade note?
2015-03-06T14:49:25  <berick> i'm surprised usr_note allows null.  that's atypical, but could be for a reason i'm not aware of.
2015-03-06T14:50:02  <berick> kmlussier: yes.  fixing it automatically via the upgrade script is problematic, too.
2015-03-06T14:51:25  <berick> well, we could default to NOW() on the new usr_message's, but leave the usr_notes with a NULL creat_date
2015-03-06T14:51:29  <Dyrcona> berick: I was just about to ask if you thought the nullability should be removed.
2015-03-06T14:51:35  <berick> that's a little hinky, though
2015-03-06T14:52:00  <berick> Dyrcona: yeah, i do think it should be removed.
2015-03-06T14:52:15  <Dyrcona> I think so, too, at this point.
2015-03-06T14:53:37  <berick> that leaves the question of what to set it to and can we do it automatically.
2015-03-06T14:54:28  * berick sets it to the date of the first commit in the EG repo ;)
2015-03-06T14:55:40  <kmlussier> berick++ :)
2015-03-06T14:56:46  <Dyrcona> An upgrade script that sets it to now() would work for me, or maybe something in the release notes suggesting people use an appropriate date like a migration date or something.
2015-03-06T14:57:06  <gmcharlt> yeah
2015-03-06T14:57:07  <berick> yeah, an upgrade note is a good start.

2015-03-06T16:13:26  <jeff> yeah, that's new with 13.mumble
2015-03-06T16:13:54  * csharp muses that if there's more and more divergence between the distros we support that we should consider breaking out the README into per-distro instructions
2015-03-06T16:13:59  <jeff> there's an "ejabberdctl convert_to_yaml" to convert old-style to new.
2015-03-06T16:14:12  <csharp> oh - that's handy
2015-03-06T16:14:24  <kmlussier> Rather than trying to fit in the two new bill OU settings in the Circ/Bills section of the docs, I think I'm going to create a new section under Library Settings editor that addresses all settings related to bills.
2015-03-06T16:14:43  <kmlussier> csharp / jeff: Whenever I see yaml, I keep thinking you're talking about yboston
2015-03-06T16:14:45  <jeff> blog post from 2013 claims ``You are now pleased to use ejabberd community as reference for stable releases of ejabberd, from the master branch. ejabberd 2.1.x support is discontinued.''
2015-03-06T16:15:20  <csharp> kmlussier: heh - I was wondering why he wasn't answering :-P
2015-03-06T16:15:31  <gmcharlt> csharp: I hope that evil day does not come (split installation instructions)
2015-03-06T16:15:43  <Dyrcona> Actually, Process One, the main force behind ejabberd are looking for erlang programmers.
2015-03-06T16:15:45  <csharp> gmcharlt: I was pondering asciidoc includes
2015-03-06T16:15:48  <yboston> :)
2015-03-06T16:16:01  <gmcharlt> csharp: ah, that sounds better
2015-03-06T16:16:04  <Dyrcona> I saw it on G+ yesterday.
2015-03-06T16:16:12  <jeff> on the Debian side of things, Jessie and up ship with ejabberd 14.
2015-03-06T16:16:34  <csharp> so ejabberd changes and systemd - sounds like fun!
2015-03-06T16:19:26  <csharp> for now I will create a branch for Fedora 21 README changes in the as-is file
2015-03-06T16:22:06  <jeff> csharp: and of course there are outstanding systemd-related bugs against the ejabberd package in Debian. :-)
2015-03-06T16:23:15  * mmorgan scratches head ...
2015-03-06T16:23:27  <mmorgan> http://catalog.noblenet.org/eg/opac/record/3053965
2015-03-06T16:23:36  <mmorgan> http://evergreen.noblenet.org/eg/opac/record/3053965
2015-03-06T16:23:49  <mmorgan> both of these links go to the same place, but "catalog" shows links to Novelist while "evergreen" does not. Not sure why this would be.
2015-03-06T16:25:09  <jeff> at least some Novelist add-ons are enabled by environment variables set in the Apache config. That config is likely different between those two hostnames?
2015-03-06T16:26:07  <jeff> if that's not it, then it's possible that the novelist product in question is configured for a specific hostname.
2015-03-06T16:27:17  <mmorgan> will poke around some more. To confuse things further, we have 4 bricks, and connecting to them directly shows the links. evergreen is the only hostname that doesn't

2015-03-06T17:00:43  <jeff> i think 3.x became 13.x
2015-03-06T17:09:14  <gmcharlt> mmorgan: I've taken a look at it, and I don't see anything in the vhost config that explains it
2015-03-06T17:09:34  <gmcharlt> and since both catalog.* and evergreen.* do pull in Novelist content
2015-03-06T17:09:45  <kmlussier> The default item price library setting - is it used for long overdue as well as lost transactions?
2015-03-06T17:09:46  <gmcharlt> my suspicion is that the issue is no Novellist's end
2015-03-06T17:10:16  <gmcharlt> specifically since the novelist plus link is going to http://evergreen.noblenet.org/cgi-bin/ezproxy/...
2015-03-06T17:11:06  <gmcharlt> novelist's code may be assuming that requests whose referrer is evergreen.nobenet.org don't need the ezproxy link
2015-03-06T17:11:26  <mmorgan> gmcharlt: Thanks for looking. I was trying to decide whether it was a Novelist issue or not, and thinking it was not. But I'll contact them given this info.

2015-03-06T17:40:38  <vlewis> I need to create a new user, one without permissions, to test a grant permission function.  I'm in a developer environment.  Is there a set of instructions I could look at?  Thanks.
2015-03-06T17:42:32  <csharp> vlewis: can you explain what you mean by "without permissions"?
2015-03-06T17:43:02  <csharp> vlewis: all users have to belong to a permission group
2015-03-06T17:46:11  <vlewis> One without admin permissions
2015-03-06T17:49:17  <csharp> vlewis: sorry, not trying to be obtuse, but do you mean a user that is not *the* "admin" user (that is, a superuser)?
2015-03-06T17:52:06  <vlewis> I think that's what I need.  I'm going to grant permission to the admin user and I need to make sure I exclude other users.
2015-03-06T17:53:00  <vlewis> There are certain pages I only want the admin to be able to get to because they can set delete flags in the database from that page.
2015-03-06T17:54:39  <csharp> vlewis: we might be talking past each other here... to clarify from my side, there is a single "admin user" that is a special administrative user created when Evergreen is installed to perform server setup functions that are not available to library staff users
2015-03-06T17:55:31  <vlewis> I'm talking about staff client users that have admin permissions.
2015-03-06T17:55:37  <csharp> then there are "local admins" or "global admins" (depending on your setup) that will be privileged users that are actually human beings (but who still don't have *every* permission assigned)
2015-03-06T17:55:41  <csharp> ah

2015-03-06T17:56:52  <csharp> okay - then that sort of permission setup would be done in Admin -> Server Administration -> Permission Groups (to create the perm group you want) and the user is created in the staff client Circulation -> Register Patron, then assign the group
2015-03-06T17:57:39  <csharp> but depending on what you're doing, you may be able to assign an existing group
2015-03-06T17:58:07  <vlewis> csharp: Do I need to set library locations.  I'm not at a specific location.
2015-03-06T17:58:32  <csharp> vlewis: yes, each staff member needs a working location assigned for perms to work
2015-03-06T17:58:58  <csharp> *some* perms work without that, but many/most don't (or shouldn't, by design)
2015-03-06T17:59:09  <vlewis> csharp: I'm in a development environment.  I don't have a location.
2015-03-06T17:59:24  <csharp> vlewis: did you install the sample data?
2015-03-06T17:59:47  <csharp> and I'm pretty sure example org units are set up by default
2015-03-06T18:00:00  <csharp> e.g. BR1, BR2, etc.
2015-03-06T18:00:51  <vlewis> csharp:  I have data in my database.
2015-03-06T18:01:33  <csharp> vlewis: okay, then you should have the example org units set up - you can see them in Admin -> Server Administration -> Organizational Units
2015-03-06T18:04:49  <vlewis> csharp:  I have a long list of org units  under Organizational Units.
2015-03-06T18:05:50  <csharp> vlewis: okay - then those can be working locations as long as they can have users
2015-03-06T18:06:27  <csharp> vlewis: in the user (patron) account, you can go to Other -> User Permission Editor and add a working location there
2015-03-06T18:15:10  <vlewis> Just to back up a little. When I make a user (patron)  account will they be able to access the staff client?
2015-03-06T18:18:52  <jeffdavis> /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -ldbdpgsql
2015-03-06T18:18:54  <csharp> vlewis: yes, if they are assigned a permission profile with the STAFF_LOGIN permission
