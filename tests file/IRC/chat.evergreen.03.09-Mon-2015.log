2015-03-09T15:35:35  <Dyrcona> jeffdavis: You might have added permissions to them.
2015-03-09T15:35:46  <Dyrcona> I don't think they come that way in stock.
2015-03-09T15:36:12  <Dyrcona> I know we've added permissions to some org unit settings, but can't say which ones off the top of my head.
2015-03-09T15:36:36  <Dyrcona> Also, they may have had permissions at one time, that were removed in the schema files, but no upgrade script was made.
2015-03-09T15:36:59  <Dyrcona> I vaguely recall something like that happening once, but could be a faulty memory.
2015-03-09T15:37:33  <Dyrcona> I do believe the only thing with permissions in stock these days are related to credit card processor settings.
2015-03-09T15:37:47  <Dyrcona> View permission, anyway.
2015-03-09T15:40:42  <jeffdavis> I'm quite sure we added perms to the affected settings. But the issue is that the behavior governed by the settings is not affected by the setting, not that you can't view/edit the settings in the settings editor interface.
