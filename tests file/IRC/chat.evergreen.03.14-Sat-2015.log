2015-03-14T09:25:32  <MrMayor> Anyone here this morning? And if so, do you know if it is possible to assiang a circ duration rule to a specific permission group instead of an item?

2015-03-14T13:18:33  <gsams> @later tell MrMayor I believe that you can do this by creating a circulation policy that leaves the circulation modifier blank.  You would simply set the Org Unit and the Permission Group, and omit item related information.  With that said, I believe anything item related would override if there is anything like that.  Others can certainly correct my logic there.
2015-03-14T13:18:33  <pinesol_green> gsams: The operation succeeded.
