2015-03-17T10:09:52  * mmorgan missed a fun holds discussion on Friday! ... and has a question :)
2015-03-17T10:10:21  <mmorgan> Within a soft-stalling period, if there's a hold for pickup at Abbot Library, and Abbot does not own a copy, does the soft stalling interval still apply?
2015-03-17T10:15:56  * kmlussier doesn't remember.
2015-03-17T10:18:10  <kmlussier> mmorgan: I haven't tested it, but I think it would. Because the stalling is there to give the library who has it on their pull list time to pull it.
2015-03-17T10:18:28  <kmlussier> The pull list library most likely wouldn't be the pickup library in this case.
2015-03-17T10:19:25  <bshum> The soft stalling should still apply to keep any other library (not targeted) from capturing the hold opportunistically.
2015-03-17T10:21:35  <kmlussier> Way back when we were first learning about Evergreen, I found that phasefx's explanation in this thread - http://georgialibraries.markmail.org/thread/ulkblq7rgzcj7g64 - very helpful.
2015-03-17T10:26:24  <mmorgan> ok, so during the stalling interval, only the single targeted copy could fill the hold. I think that's the part that was never quite clear to me.
2015-03-17T10:26:45  <kmlussier> Or, if an opportunistic capture happens at the pickup library.
2015-03-17T10:27:26  <mmorgan> kmlussier: Oh right! Because even if the pickup library doesn't own it, another library's copy could get checked in there.
2015-03-17T10:30:29  * mmorgan fits another piece into the million piece jigsaw puzzle that is Evergreen holds :)

2015-03-17T11:02:47  <berick> hmm, there are a number of docs commits in master that were not back-ported to rel_2_8.  most of them look related to 2.8, so I'm going to back-port for RC1
2015-03-17T11:04:04  <kmlussier> Is there any documentation or even rough notes on how to go about installing hatch?
2015-03-17T11:04:18  <berick> there's a readme for linux in the repository
2015-03-17T11:04:42  <berick> phasefx said recently that he installed on windows, possible he documented it
2015-03-17T11:05:23  <kmlussier> The readme will work for me.
2015-03-17T11:05:59  <kmlussier> And I think these must be the Windows instructions? https://raw.githubusercontent.com/phasefx/random/hatch/README.win
2015-03-17T11:06:00  <bshum> berick: It's probably that the docs folks didn't realize there was already the rel_2_8 branch
2015-03-17T11:06:32  <berick> bshum: that's my assumption

2015-03-17T11:26:36  <Dyrcona> jmccarty: Does /tmp/reporter.lock or whatever exist?
2015-03-17T11:27:04  <jmccarty> no reporter.lock file in /tmp
2015-03-17T11:27:05  <Dyrcona> jmccarty: /tmp/reporter-LOCK
2015-03-17T11:27:17  <Dyrcona> Sorry. Had to look it up.
2015-03-17T11:27:35  <jmccarty> no worries, reporter-LOCK does not exist in /tmp either
2015-03-17T11:28:13  <Dyrcona> So, you run the start script and get no output and clark isn't running? I've never seen that. It has always printed an error on screen.
2015-03-17T11:28:22  <yboston> EG conference question, who should I contact to ask if there are plans to reserve meeting time for various Eg groups like the authoritites group or the cataloging group?
2015-03-17T11:30:05  <kmlussier> yboston: Beth Longwell had sent a message to the list a couple of weeks ago asking people about interest groups. So I would say she's the person.
2015-03-17T11:30:11  <jmccarty> yeah, I run the script and afterwards it says you have new mail in /var/mail/opensrf and then I check the results with ps -f | grep -i clark and it shows nothing (usually shows clark-kent waiting for trouble [or something to that effect])
2015-03-17T11:30:21  <kmlussier> I already asked her about authorities, though. Because I wanted the cheese flan.
2015-03-17T11:31:07  <kmlussier> yboston: bshum is on programming. He might know if something is already scheduled.
2015-03-17T11:31:09  <yboston> kmlussier: I have no recollection of that email, if you have a copy can you send it to me? also, PM me so we can arrange the quid pro cuo

2015-03-17T11:32:05  <bshum> yboston: kmlussier: Programs committee is still ongoing in terms of finalizing the schedule, we had some preliminary stuff we're still batting around in committee.
2015-03-17T11:32:24  <bshum> That said, the last draft included dedicated time slots for Cataloging, Authorities interest groups.
2015-03-17T11:32:28  <kmlussier> berick: I've seen some information on that, but I don't know if it's been firmed up enough to share. buzzy was handling it.
2015-03-17T11:32:38  <bshum> Well, "dedicated" meaning they'll be on the schedule somewhere.
2015-03-17T11:32:39  <yboston> bshum: is the catalogign group in consideration for getting a meeting time?
2015-03-17T11:32:47  <yboston> bshum: if you happen to recall
2015-03-17T11:32:57  <yboston> bshum: thanks
2015-03-17T11:33:55  <bshum> blongwell is lead on the programs committee and I do believe she did send something about interest groups already.  I expect she'll do a follow-up on that soon.
2015-03-17T11:35:00  <berick> thanks, kmlussier
2015-03-17T11:36:20  <yboston> I am "allegedly" an idiot, I saw Beth's email and just focused on the survey and completed it. I missed the part about the interest groups

2015-03-17T13:31:10  *** Dyrcona has joined #evergreen
2015-03-17T13:36:08  <DPearl> bshum: Hi, Ben.  I have desk-checked the code and it looks fine.  I am shortly going to try it on a 2.7.4 after I get that up on my dev machine to repro the problem, which I haven't seen.  The original bug fix commit looks complete.
2015-03-17T13:47:16  <bshum> DPearl: Okay, let us know what you see on your next test system.  I'm still poking at it slowly myself to try figuring out where things went awry.
2015-03-17T13:49:50  <Dyrcona> Probably because it updates the monograph part to point to the new record, any link with the old is broken and not preserved.
2015-03-17T13:51:30  <Dyrcona> There's a pcrud update going on in the JavaScript.
2015-03-17T13:53:29  <bshum> Well I would have expected something to change the copy map to point at the new part before the delete. But yeah, hmm...
2015-03-17T13:57:53  <DPearl> Is the pcrud update asynchronous?  Is there some mechanism for a callback which I need to use.  As it is written, the intention is to write out the new copy_map items, then it will get rid of the unneeded parts.  If the pcrud update has not occured, then getting rid of the part will get rid of the copy_part map entry.
2015-03-17T13:58:05  <Dyrcona> Well, the bug suggests that someone expects the old copy part map to remain.
2015-03-17T13:58:37  <Dyrcona> Ah. Maybe I misunderstand the problem.
2015-03-17T14:00:39  <Dyrcona> I don't think it should be asynchronous, but I don't know the JavaScript that well.
2015-03-17T14:02:39  <eeevil> DPearl: what js lib are you using to make the pcrud calls? there are a few different ways to do it. and, there are sync and async versions. but what you probably want to do is just create the fieldmapper objects you want (with isdeleted, isnew, ischanged set to a truthy value as needed) and then use pcrud.apply()
2015-03-17T14:03:45  <Dyrcona> eeevil: it uses pcrud.update().
2015-03-17T14:04:24  <eeevil> Dyrcona: for updates, yes. and pcrud.create() and pcrud.eliminate() (IIRC) for insert and delete
2015-03-17T14:04:35  <eeevil> Dyrcona: or, do you mean the existing code, sorry
2015-03-17T14:05:50  <eeevil> aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaand, gtalk is broke

2015-03-17T16:01:08  <Dyrcona> Too much to keep up with.
2015-03-17T16:02:14  <jeffdavis> Are there good reasons not to just use github if we were to move away from gitolite/launchpad?
2015-03-17T16:02:16  <kmlussier> berick: Links are updated
2015-03-17T16:02:45  <berick> kmlussier++ thanks!
2015-03-17T16:03:29  <Dyrcona> A better issue tracker than github's might be desirable.
2015-03-17T16:04:24  <Dyrcona> I wanted to experiment with Gitorious' code at some point but never made the time.
2015-03-17T16:05:19  <Dyrcona> So, I only have two projects on gitorious and I'm watching three others, one of which belongs to dbs.
2015-03-17T16:05:34  <bshum> jeffdavis: I think people also had some qualms about being hosted by a third party that wasn't open source and under our full control.
2015-03-17T16:05:47  <bshum> We kind of talked about some ideas in Vancouver at different tables and meetings, but we didn't get too far along.
2015-03-17T16:07:48  <bshum> That said, I'm not committed to any particular system.
2015-03-17T16:08:03  <Dyrcona> IIRC, github, gitorious, gitlabs were all discussed.
2015-03-17T16:08:45  <Dyrcona> I'd like better bug searching, but I've not found too many ticket/bug systems with decent search.

2015-03-17T16:12:03  <Dyrcona> Maybe I'll try gitlab for "fun."
2015-03-17T16:15:12  <Dyrcona> Funny. gogs is hosted on github. :)
