2015-03-18T09:38:14  <csharp> I'm working on a method of getting the effective permission set for a given permission group (and after that, for a particular user)
2015-03-18T09:39:04  <csharp> what I'd like is to be able to enter something like 'Circ1' and get the aggregated permissions from each ancestor group so it's a full list of non-duplicated perms
2015-03-18T09:39:16  <csharp> has anyone worked up something like that?
2015-03-18T09:39:43  <csharp> I've seen the magic spells that do something similar, but it's not aggregating them in the way I was hoping
2015-03-18T09:40:35  <csharp> (for the logs, I'm referring to http://wiki.evergreen-ils.org/doku.php?id=scratchpad:random_magic_spells#comparing_permissions_between_multiple_permission_groups)

2015-03-18T10:20:06  <phasefx> csharp: may be easier to use the has_permission stored procedure against some "reference" users for each group
2015-03-18T10:21:08  <phasefx> of course, that's also org specific

2015-03-18T12:41:10  <mmorgan> There is another page that displays users and their associated groups.

2015-03-18T14:28:45  * dbs figures it's worth asking "for a friend", does anyone automatically email checkout receipts with embedded ICS invites as a way to help people remember when they have items to return / renew?

2015-03-18T14:36:13  <pinesol_green> kmlussier: Quote #41: "<phasefx> when you guys stab me later, make sure it's with a double-dagger" (added by gmcharlt at 05:23 PM, January 07, 2013)
2015-03-18T14:37:48  <kmlussier> dbs: So the use case is that the patron can add the due date to their calendar directly from the email checkout receipt? That's interesting.
2015-03-18T14:49:32  <dbs> kmlussier: yep, that's pretty much it
2015-03-18T14:50:02  <graced> that's a really neat idea
2015-03-18T14:50:09  <dbs> rather than waiting for a reminder notice, our faculty in particular are very calendar-driven
2015-03-18T14:51:21  <dbs> It's not without its challenges (e.g. person takes out 5 items and returns 2; the calendar entry isn't going to change from whatever the invite said)
2015-03-18T14:51:39  <dbs> but at the very least the details could link them to their "My Account" to double check :)
2015-03-18T14:52:58  <kmlussier> So library elf used to add checkout dates to my calendar. But I think it was done through an ical feed. The feed updated regularly, which solved the issue of removing the calendar entry when the item was checked in.
2015-03-18T14:56:44  <dbs> Hmm. Caldav maybe?
2015-03-18T14:57:22  <dbs> I guess an alternate approach would be to add a CalDAV link from My Account
2015-03-18T14:59:06  <dbs> but that would mean running a CalDAV server, which probably wouldn't be fun

2015-03-18T16:56:00  <gsams> Anyone have a suggestion for a SQL query to count titles?  I've created a report that isn't working as intended and don't really have anything substantial to compare it to.
2015-03-18T16:56:33  <gsams> My title report is reporting more titles than I have in items, using similar filters.
2015-03-18T16:57:00  <jeff> keep in mind that it's quite possible to have titles without items.
2015-03-18T16:57:26  <gsams> Yeah, I filtered those out.  Or I tried to at least
2015-03-18T17:00:17  <gsams> I filtered deleted items, NULL call numbers, and Discard/Weed status items.
2015-03-18T17:00:35  *** vlewis_ has joined #evergreen
2015-03-18T17:01:08  <gsams> I suppose I should drop the count and get some details to see what is going on a bit more clearly.
