2015-03-24T11:06:49  <jboyer-isl> No doubt, I don't care for the ugly scripts I put together to try to purge covers once they're corrected upstream, this is going to be really handy.
2015-03-24T11:06:52  <jboyer-isl> tsbere++
2015-03-24T11:09:09  <jboyer-isl> It is literally infuriating to use the same keyboard on a Mac and a Windows machine. I never know which wrong-o keyboard shortcut I'll activate next. (Windows users, try Win + arrow keys. Now imagine you're trying to select text!)
2015-03-24T11:09:55  <tsbere> Anyone think I should add a "just clear the jacket images" variant of the staff link somewhere (say, under/next to the image in the first place)?
2015-03-24T11:10:37  * Dyrcona thinks so.
2015-03-24T11:10:53  <Dyrcona> That's the most common thing staff want cleared.
2015-03-24T11:11:18  <tsbere> Yea, but if they changed the ISBNs instead of upstream having changed things then the other added content pieces will need clearing too. :/
2015-03-24T11:11:37  <Dyrcona> For the channel: This arose out of a ticket where a cataloger asked why a jacket didn't clear immediately after an ISBN was moved to subfield z.
2015-03-24T11:12:45  <tsbere> I originally went with "quick command line script that accepts one or more record IDs" but decided "can be triggered by staff in general" was a better solution to not have tech staff driven nuts with "run the script to clear this record" requests. ;)
2015-03-24T11:15:08  <tsbere> and now I have apache config blocks for "only let staff do that" in the branch.
2015-03-24T11:15:44  * tsbere is still undecided on the "just jacket images" link, the code supports it, but the link will look really out of place if there is no image....
2015-03-24T11:16:44  <Dyrcona> It could always be added later if there was demand.

2015-03-24T13:26:03  <Bmagic> I really don't like how long the fine generator takes, when most of the output is rolling back, rolling back. Can I make the fine generator code run against a list of circs manually?
2015-03-24T13:27:26  <tsbere> Bmagic: I believe that is possible, given that checkin runs it for a single transaction
2015-03-24T13:28:12  <tsbere> Bmagic: In fact, go read fine_generator.pl. It shows how to make such a request as it does it when you tell it to run more than one at a time.
2015-03-24T13:28:54  <Bmagic> tsbere: yeah, I am seeing that
2015-03-24T13:29:20  <Bmagic> I suppose I could copy this script and add a query to feed into the loop instead of the results from open-ils.storage.action.circulation.overdue.id_list
2015-03-24T13:30:49  <tsbere> Bmagic: Or if you know your circ IDs just fire off a pile of "request open-ils.storage open-ils.storage.action.circulation.overdue.generate_fines <id>" calls from srfsh
2015-03-24T13:31:07  <Bmagic> tsbere: ah, not bad
2015-03-24T13:31:31  <Dyrcona> There were some recent changes to make this faster,  but I don't recall if they made it into 2.7.
2015-03-24T13:31:41  <Dyrcona> May be in 2.8.
2015-03-24T13:31:52  <Dyrcona> i.e. the fine generator.
