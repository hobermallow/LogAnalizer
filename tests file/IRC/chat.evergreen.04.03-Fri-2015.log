2015-04-03T09:12:54  <kmlussier> Is there a reason why, on the downloads page, we link to release notes at http://evergreen-ils.org/documentation/release/RELEASE_NOTES_2_8.html instead of linking to the ones in the official docs?
2015-04-03T09:13:51  <kmlussier> Well, I guess it looks nicer to have the entirety of the release notes listed on one page. I withdraw my question.
2015-04-03T09:15:43  <kmlussier> berick: I made some additions to the release notes yesterday that will need to be incorporated in the notes we link to from the downloads page. But I expect more tweaking to happen early next week. so you may want to hold off until then.

2015-04-03T10:25:51  <kmlussier> I suspect I was wrong because I didn't realize the secondary permission group button never appears with new registrations.

2015-04-03T11:58:11  <kmlussier> The example text on the patron registration form typically only displays if there is a regex supplied in the OU settings.
2015-04-03T11:58:30  <kmlussier> But the DOB example text displays even if the "Format Dates with this pattern" setting is null.
2015-04-03T11:59:09  <kmlussier> How does the system decide what to show as an example, in that case? Is it hardcoded to mm/dd/yyyy. Or is it looking at some other setting?
2015-04-03T12:03:00  <jeffdavis> Last I checked, the example was hardcoded.

2015-04-03T13:20:32  <Bmagic> When a patron has a long overdue item, and they use the OPAC, their account summary will have a one in parenthesis (1) indicating that have 1 item checked out. When you click on it, the resulting page says "You have no items checked out"
2015-04-03T13:21:02  <Bmagic> Would this be because the code that sifts the items from action.circulation does not include the long overdue status?
2015-04-03T13:23:21  <Bmagic> Another way to phrase it: Should "special" circulations be considered at all in this context?
2015-04-03T13:25:00  <bshum> Hmm, that seems like a good thing to look at.
2015-04-03T13:25:53  <bshum> Depends on what long overdue means?
2015-04-03T13:26:13  <bshum> For me, I would think to show those circs to the user and count them.
2015-04-03T13:26:35  <bshum> But maybe this is a case for YAOUS? :\
2015-04-03T13:27:09  <kmlussier> I would consider long overdues to still be checked out.
2015-04-03T13:27:11  <berick> i think they should show, too.
2015-04-03T13:27:14  <Bmagic> What does the TPAC do for Lost?
2015-04-03T13:27:21  <Bmagic> I think we have a bug here
2015-04-03T13:27:21  <kmlussier> Which is a distinct difference from what it should do for lost.
2015-04-03T13:27:40  <Bmagic> the TPAC says that they have 1 item checked out, but when you view the items that they have checked out, it shows none
2015-04-03T13:28:47  <kmlussier> We have an OU setting that says whether lost items should be included in the staff client count. I would think you would want the tpac count to be the same as the staff client count.
2015-04-03T13:29:46  <berick> for LO, the fix is simple.  Account.pm:1385, remove 'LONGOVERDUE' from the array
2015-04-03T13:29:52  <berick> for tpac display
2015-04-03T13:30:16  <Bmagic> so, the count is different than the list of check outs?
2015-04-03T13:30:21  <Bmagic> and there is a setting for this?
2015-04-03T13:30:58  <kmlussier> Bmagic: There is a setting just for lost. Not long overdue. And it's for the patron summary only, not tpac.
2015-04-03T13:31:23  <Bmagic> kmlussier: I am speaking about the OPAC/TPAC only
2015-04-03T13:32:10  <kmlussier> Yes, I know. I was just musing that it would make sense for it to handle both counts.
2015-04-03T13:32:15  * kmlussier will stop musing now.
2015-04-03T13:32:34  <Bmagic> kmlussier: I see the setting "Items Out Long-Overdue display setting" "1 = top list, bottom list. 2 = bottom list"
2015-04-03T13:32:44  <Bmagic> Is that the setting you are talking about?
2015-04-03T13:33:02  <kmlussier> Include lost circulation in lump sum tallies in Patron Display
2015-04-03T13:33:33  <Bmagic> oh I see
2015-04-03T13:33:56  <Bmagic> So, did I uncover a bug in the OPAC/TPAC ?
2015-04-03T13:35:00  <kmlussier> For the long overdues? Yes, I would say it's a bug.
2015-04-03T13:36:19  <kmlussier> Given that there seemed to be initial consensus here that they should display as items out, I don't think a YAOUS is required. But that's just me.
2015-04-03T13:36:48  <bshum> I'd wait for csharp and his folks to weigh in.  Since longoverdue was their feature, right?
2015-04-03T13:36:48  <bshum> :)
2015-04-03T13:36:59  <kmlussier> yeah
2015-04-03T13:38:41  * mmorgan thinks that "long overdue" implies that they are still checked out. But maybe that's just me :)

2015-04-03T13:39:21  <Bmagic> https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B8kJTfmejGJ1TU1CLTNzRTl1N2s/view?usp=sharing
2015-04-03T13:42:08  <kmlussier> Whatever the desired behavior is, I think the fact that the count displays and then no titles display is a bug. It's just a matter of nailing down whether it should be part of the count and listed or whether it shouldn't. We can work that out on the bug report.
2015-04-03T13:45:33  <Bmagic> I took a quick peek at a patron who has the same scenario but instead of long overdue, it was lost, and it didn't show (1) for the lost circ

2015-04-03T14:22:51  <kmlussier> poof!
2015-04-03T14:24:22  <csharp> so, our issue is one of terminology, I think, and "longoverdue" has been fraught with misunderstanding and ambiguity since its inception
2015-04-03T14:24:54  <csharp> what we *wanted* was "auto-lost but use the term 'longoverdue' to show that it was system set"
2015-04-03T14:25:19  <csharp> some of our specifications were vague on some of the finer points, so there are some differences
2015-04-03T14:25:41  <csharp> the main one being whether longoverdue and paid for items should show on a patron account
2015-04-03T14:26:12  <kmlussier> Oh, but in this case are they paid for or are they just long overdue?
2015-04-03T14:26:33  <csharp> s/items/circs/  - even the terminology can get confusing just talking about it ;-)
2015-04-03T14:27:10  <csharp> we probably want them to act like Lost items and *not* show
2015-04-03T14:27:47  <csharp> but I can understand the thought behind the "longoverdue means still checked out" that led to the fact that they *do* continue to show after payment
2015-04-03T14:27:52  <kmlussier> csharp: OK, in that case then, it probably would be worthwhile to have a YAOUS.
2015-04-03T14:28:00  <csharp> I haven't seen Bmagic's issue yet, though
2015-04-03T14:28:16  <csharp> kmlussier: I agree, since there are different expectations
2015-04-03T14:28:27  <kmlussier> And I hadn't considered the after payment question. I think my opinion is different for longoverdues that have been paid.
2015-04-03T14:28:46  <Dyrcona> Well, for that you have lostandpaid.
2015-04-03T14:28:53  <Dyrcona> At least, you do now. ;)

2015-04-03T14:30:44  <csharp> kmlussier: yup
2015-04-03T14:31:08  <kmlussier> csharp: We also have a couple of sites that are very happy the longoverdue functionality is there.
2015-04-03T14:31:23  <csharp> overall, we're really happy with it
2015-04-03T14:31:25  <Dyrcona> It's the same as lost, just a different name.
2015-04-03T14:31:31  <kmlussier> Although, even here, there are differences in the way our sites are implementing it.
2015-04-03T14:31:42  <csharp> if the paid-for longoverdues didn't show on the list of items out, we'd be cool
2015-04-03T14:31:56  <Dyrcona> We don't use it or lostand paid. We'd figured it would cause too much confusion. :)
2015-04-03T14:32:15  <csharp> and obviously, if Bmagic's OPAC-side issue affects us, we'll want that fix too
2015-04-03T14:32:26  <Dyrcona> csharp: That is a bug, IMO.
2015-04-03T14:32:46  <csharp> Dyrcona: the irony is that "longoverdue" was chosen so that it would be immediately clear to staff what had happened
2015-04-03T14:33:11  <Dyrcona> csharp: Yes, that seems like it would be simpler to explain than "lost" which could have different meanings.
2015-04-03T14:33:18  <csharp> after we implemented it, though, we got lots of "what is this?" tickets
2015-04-03T14:33:33  <Dyrcona> But, having a committee vote to change a numeric limit from 10 to 20 is enough to confuse some people.
2015-04-03T14:33:52  <csharp> Dyrcona: heh - we've got lots of examples like that
2015-04-03T14:34:39  <Dyrcona> In our case, all of the limits were 20 but this one, so the Executive committee decided it would be less confusing to make this one 20 also. :)
2015-04-03T14:34:57  <Dyrcona> Confusion over the change ensues....
2015-04-03T14:35:00  <csharp> "and now we have X+1 problems..."
2015-04-03T14:35:13  <Dyrcona> In general, I think librarians, and circ staff in particular, do not like change.
2015-04-03T14:35:47  * Dyrcona has a MSLS, so is technically a librarian.
2015-04-03T14:37:15  <Dyrcona> csharp: And tomorrow it will be X+2. :)
2015-04-03T14:55:34  <Bmagic> csharp: we adpoted it with the thought that long overdue would happen first, then eventually the trigger to make them lost would come later. We didn't want the same functionality as lost in the mean time
2015-04-03T14:56:20  <Bmagic> csharp: So we introduced the library setting "Assess Billing When Marked Long-Overdue" from this bug https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1331174
2015-04-03T14:56:20  <pinesol_green> Launchpad bug 1331174 in Evergreen "Long Overdue processing needs org unit settings separate from Lost Processing" (affected: 3, heat: 14) [Wishlist,Confirmed]
2015-04-03T15:01:52  <mmorgan> Bmagic: Have you implemented this?
2015-04-03T15:02:31  <Bmagic> mmorgan: We were sort of waiting for it to be tested, now that it has, we are feeling good about merging it
2015-04-03T15:06:23  <mmorgan> gotcha. How were you thinking of using the Long Overdue vs. Lost?
2015-04-03T15:35:17  <Bmagic> mmorgan: So the trigger would turn something into long overdue and fire an alert to the patron at 20 days overdue and not bill. Then at 40 days overdue, the trigger would mark them lost and bill them accordingly. For example.

2015-04-03T15:40:26  <mmorgan> Ok, thanks. We were thinking similarly. Probably longer intervals, though. We would also use the long overdue status to help staff identify the items better, and block the patron appropriately.

2015-04-03T16:26:54  <jonadab> Just one more data point, the phrase "long overdue" to our staff means something different from "lost".  "lost" means the patron's account has been charged for the item, "long overdue" merely means they can't check other items out until they deal with the item (either bring it back or declare it lost), IIRC.  Something like that.

2015-04-03T16:52:02  <mmorgan> jonadab: Yes, that's what this option is meant to allow. A way to identify the items as seriously overdue, and provide a condition that can apply a block to the patron.
2015-04-03T16:53:15  <jonadab> Sounds good.

2015-04-03T17:17:42  <Bmagic> What does a "-1" mean in the context of hold status? Inside a patron xul UI?
2015-04-03T17:18:49  <Bmagic> Another example of a status would be "Waiting for Copy"
2015-04-03T17:18:55  <berick> Bmagic: it means there's something inconsistent with with the hold
2015-04-03T17:19:01  <berick> "something ain't right"
2015-04-03T17:19:30  <Bmagic> berick: so it won't be filled? In this example, there is a current copy
2015-04-03T17:20:34  <berick> what's the copy status?
2015-04-03T17:20:35  <phasefx> Bmagic: happens most often with data migrations, say, a hold thinks it has something on the hold shelf but the item status doesn't agree
2015-04-03T17:20:37  <Bmagic> available
2015-04-03T17:20:49  <berick> that's it
2015-04-03T17:20:56  <berick> it should be on-holds-shelf or in-transit
2015-04-03T17:20:58  <Bmagic> could be the reshelver?
2015-04-03T17:21:00  *** Newziky has left #evergreen
2015-04-03T17:21:36  <berick> if it was captured while reshelver was running, maybe
2015-04-03T17:22:45  <Bmagic> Thanks, I think that will get me to the answer
