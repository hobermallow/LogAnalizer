2015-04-06T13:43:59  <Dyrcona> :)
2015-04-06T13:44:20  <rjackson_isl> into the wild blue yonder
2015-04-06T13:46:51  <jboyer-isl> I need to find some better clients. At home I have to use the / commands, at work I have to use the menus.
2015-04-06T13:48:46  <rjackson_isl> at least you have an excuse - I just interrupt mtgs by typing in the wrong window! :(
2015-04-06T14:03:19  <jeff> open-ils.circ.mark_item_missing_pieces requires the permission MARK_ITEM_MISSING_PIECES, but depending on circumstances and configuration, will fail if the calling user does not also have CIRC_OVERRIDE_DUE_DATE.
2015-04-06T14:08:21  <jeff> this probably isn't the only example of "this action requires multiple permissions", and that in and of itself isn't bad, and the scenario of "staff member who should have MARK_ITEM_MISSING_PIECES but should not have CIRC_OVERRIDE_DUE_DATE" might be uncommon.
2015-04-06T14:09:14  <Dyrcona> I believe our generic circ accounts have both.
2015-04-06T14:09:15  <jeff> it does have me wondering if there's a good method of "require user to have this perm or require that this method be being called internally" (over-simplifying the idea for purposes of brevity)
2015-04-06T14:09:53  <Dyrcona> I'm not sure what you're saying there.
2015-04-06T14:10:52  <jboyer-isl> jeff: Are you basically saying there should be a parameter that says “The user has a more important permission for the task at hand, don’t worry if they’re lacking one that you’re about to check for”
2015-04-06T14:11:12  <jboyer-isl> kind of like an .override, but for permission checks?>
2015-04-06T14:12:18  <jeff> if I grant a user MARK_ITEM_MISSING_PIECES but not CIRC_OVERRIDE_DUE_DATE, I'm setting things up for failure. It might be interesting to have a way for open-ils.circ.mark_item_missing_pieces's checkout call not require the user to have CIRC_OVERRIDE_DUE_DATE by nature of the missing pieces api method being the "caller".
2015-04-06T14:12:38  <jeff> I'm not yet certain that it would be THAT useful, I'm just thinking out loud. :-)
2015-04-06T14:13:35  <Dyrcona> Well, I'm not certain why mark item missing pieces would mess with the due date.
2015-04-06T14:14:37  <jeff> More immediately relevant, I'm starting to think it would be useful to have some additional developer-focused documentation on things like "assumptions made / conventions with regard to stop_fines reasons", etc.
2015-04-06T14:15:48  <jeff> Dyrcona: mark item missing pieces finds the most recent circ of a copy, and either attempts a renewal (if the circ is still open) or creates a new checkout. If the copy is needed for a hold, the checkout is passed today's date to make it "due now".
2015-04-06T14:16:44  <Dyrcona> I'm not gonna ask why.
2015-04-06T14:17:42  <jeff> It is undesired behavior in our environment.
2015-04-06T14:19:07  <jeff> But something which is desired is for the items (which have usually been checked in already) to be checked back out to the patron for a fixed one week duration involving no usual fines, then after that time they will be billed for the missing pieces / item as a whole.
2015-04-06T14:20:07  *** BigRig has quit IRC
2015-04-06T14:20:29  <jeff> I'm thinking to think of approaches that create the least amount of acrobatics.
2015-04-06T14:21:20  <csharp> missing pieces appears to already be pretty acrobatic ;-)
2015-04-06T14:21:29  <csharp> at least last time I looked ;-)
2015-04-06T14:22:44  <csharp> it doesn't work for us because of the "bring up the copy editor to add a copy note" step - we don't want circ people to have the power to edit copy attributes
2015-04-06T14:22:50  <jeff> sure.
2015-04-06T14:23:12  <csharp> and last I looked, there wasn't a way to just add a note without the full copy editor
2015-04-06T14:24:12  <jeff> I've also considered not checking the item back out, and just setting the copy status to Missing Pieces, eventually adding a billing, etc.
2015-04-06T14:26:47  <kmlussier> csharp: Hmmm...the alert development that PINES and MassLNC are jointly funding will let people add a temporary note for purposes like this one. However, I didn't even think to add something to the requirements that would make Mark Missing Pieces add the note that way instead of the traditional way.
2015-04-06T14:27:17  <jeff> Then need to determine the timeline/process by which the item will be billed either asset.copy.price or a manual partial amount. The circ may have overdue billings anyway, then a full payment would set xact_finish, which would then need to be cleared (re-opening the xact) when the item was actually billed...

2015-04-06T14:27:39  <csharp> kmlussier: even if it doesn't become a requirement for that project, building the bridge between one and the other would probably be possible later
2015-04-06T14:27:49  <kmlussier> Yes indeed!
2015-04-06T14:27:53  <jeff> And determining what to key off of for the timing of the bill (copy edit date? checkin date?) is problematic also.
2015-04-06T14:28:14  <jeff> Some part of me wants per-circ messaging/event logging.
2015-04-06T14:28:27  <jeff> which we have in a way with A/T records.
2015-04-06T14:33:02  <jeff> as it currently stands, checking the item back out to a patron with a due date 1 week in the future, notifying them that they have a week to contact us to determine what's missing, how to get it back, etc...
2015-04-06T14:33:16  <jeff> (we'd need to add that "1 week in the future" bit)
2015-04-06T14:35:08  <Dyrcona> Well, the circus comes to town when other systems want a different functionality.
2015-04-06T14:51:42  <bshum> kmlussier: I generated out the asciidoc html and put up the newest iteration of the RELEASE_NOTES_2_8 to the website:  http://evergreen-ils.org/documentation/release/RELEASE_NOTES_2_8.html

2015-04-06T14:54:07  <jeff> then if the disc/whatever doesn't come back, we bill the price of the item on file and... set MAXFINES? set a new stop_fines of MISSINGPIECES? check the item in and then re-set the copy status to Missing Pieces?

2015-04-06T17:39:43  <bshum> jeffdavis: For fun note, I just compared our PG 9.3 and 9.4 databases, and found that metabib_keyword_field_entry_index_vector_idx was definitely smaller.  From 1690 to 890 MB or so, roughly.  Which is nice.
2015-04-06T17:40:21  <bshum> I'm still continuing my tests with 9.4, but so far, it hasn't exploded yet.  So that keeps me hopeful.

2015-04-06T17:47:49  <bshum> Oh, that's of course, assuming that one has used gin there instead of gist I guess...
2015-04-06T17:54:33  <bshum> We changed most of our metabib indexes from gist to gin during a past upgrade.
2015-04-06T17:54:47  <bshum> But I guess that's not stock setup.
