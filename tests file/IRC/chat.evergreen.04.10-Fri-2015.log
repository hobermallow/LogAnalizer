2015-04-10T09:36:03  <Bmagic> Is there any setting in Evergreen to remove items from the items out screen? Lost for example? Never checked in.
2015-04-10T09:36:29  <Dyrcona> Don't think so.
2015-04-10T09:36:44  <Bmagic> So, they need to be checked in to be removed
2015-04-10T09:36:51  <Dyrcona> They only disappear when the transaction is closed, i.e. xact_finish set.
2015-04-10T09:37:01  <Dyrcona> They need to be checked in and paid up.
2015-04-10T09:37:22  <Bmagic> Checking in Lost items would be a lie
2015-04-10T09:37:36  <Bmagic> and it messes with the billing, which we dont want
2015-04-10T09:37:53  <Dyrcona> Then why do you want them to go away?
2015-04-10T09:38:11  <Dyrcona> If they are lost and the patrons owes, I think you'd want to see the transactions.
2015-04-10T09:38:20  <Bmagic> The patron doesnt owe
2015-04-10T09:38:22  <Bmagic> they paid
2015-04-10T09:38:34  <Bmagic> then you check it in, and it voids the original fine
2015-04-10T09:38:57  <Bmagic> but the item is technically checked out, and therefore, still shows in the items out screen (on the bottom)
2015-04-10T09:39:05  <Dyrcona> Right. So, you have to add a fee to balance it out.
2015-04-10T09:39:12  <mmorgan> Bmagic: There's an org unit setting to control the display of Lost items, "Items Out Lost Display Setting"
2015-04-10T09:39:23  <Bmagic> mmorgan: I discovered that setting
2015-04-10T09:39:32  <Bmagic> mmorgan: it doesn't work the way we want it to
2015-04-10T09:39:50  <Bmagic> mmorgan: it would appear that the item still needs to be checked in for it to get totally off the screen
2015-04-10T09:40:02  <Dyrcona> There's code being worked on to take care of situations like this, but two people have worked on it for over two years, so I wouldn't hold my breath.
2015-04-10T09:40:13  <mmorgan> Did you say they have paid for the item?
2015-04-10T09:40:20  <Bmagic> yep, paid
2015-04-10T09:40:37  <mmorgan> Hmm. Ours disappear at that point.
2015-04-10T09:40:38  <jeff> Bmagic: are you aware of the new "lost and paid" support?
2015-04-10T09:41:03  <Bmagic> jeff: I am aware, but it's not implemented, Would this impact our situation if we were to implement it?
2015-04-10T09:41:30  <mmorgan> What about the org unit setting "Leave transaction open when lost balance equals zero"? How is that set for you?
2015-04-10T09:44:01  * mmorgan thinks that if the transaction is closing, the item should disappear from items out.
2015-04-10T09:44:10  <Bmagic> mmorgan: Set to false
2015-04-10T09:44:25  <Bmagic> mmorgan: I think the code looks for the column checkin_time and not xact_finish
2015-04-10T09:44:55  <Dyrcona> Bmagic: It might look for both.
2015-04-10T09:44:56  *** yboston has joined #evergreen
2015-04-10T09:45:01  <mmorgan> In our experience, patron loses item, patron pays for item, item no longer shows on items out.
2015-04-10T09:45:09  <Bmagic> well, even both, means that checkin_time is required
2015-04-10T09:45:36  <Bmagic> and we are not checking it in (or don't think that's correct)
2015-04-10T09:46:46  <Bmagic> I'm going to run some more expierements
2015-04-10T09:47:38  <mmorgan> Just marked an item Lost on my test patron. Paid the bill and the item is gone from items out.
2015-04-10T09:48:12  <mmorgan> Item never got checked in.
2015-04-10T09:49:19  <Bmagic> mmorgan: that is good news, let me see what is going on here
2015-04-10T09:51:25  <kmlussier> I thought the setting mmorgan referred to above is the one that removed it from Items Out if it was fully paid. Strange that it isn't working for you that way.
2015-04-10T09:51:45  *** RoganH has joined #evergreen
2015-04-10T09:53:06  <mmorgan> "Leave transaction open when lost balance equals zero" is unset for us, and my understanding is that would default to FALSE
2015-04-10T09:53:26  <mmorgan> Could be that the transactions aren't closing for some reason.
2015-04-10T09:54:36  <bshum> Well it might be a bad setting. Meaning it's bugged and false doesn't do what we expect, while unset is better...
2015-04-10T10:02:32  <Dyrcona> Bmagic: Is that setting set to true or false or not set?
2015-04-10T10:02:51  <Dyrcona> If it is true, it will leave the transactions open on the patron account.
2015-04-10T10:03:05  <Dyrcona> At least, that is my understanding of how it is supposed to work.
2015-04-10T10:03:35  <Bmagic> it's false
2015-04-10T10:04:09  <Bmagic> I think that long overdue is part of the equation here. I am going to ask the library for some details
2015-04-10T10:04:27  <kmlussier> Bmagic: That could be. I think csharp has reported a bug on that.
2015-04-10T10:04:34  <Dyrcona> Ah, long overude.... The code may not be checking that status correctly.
2015-04-10T10:04:35  <Bmagic> oh?

2015-04-10T11:50:02  <Bmagic> yep!
2015-04-10T11:50:03  <jeff> Bmagic: and yes, now that you link that i should have remembered that bug.
2015-04-10T11:51:09  <Bmagic> Here is a related question. We are finding that Lost triggers do not run on circulations that have already been turned to long overdue. Is that correct?

2015-04-10T11:56:01  *** bbqben has quit IRC
2015-04-10T11:56:08  <berick> i'm shooting from the hip, but I think that's probably the issue
2015-04-10T11:56:30  <Bmagic> berick: My config has this code merged
2015-04-10T11:56:45  <Bmagic> my line looks like this  [ { "stop_fines"  : ["MAXFINES"] },
2015-04-10T11:57:02  <berick> hmm, actually
2015-04-10T11:57:19  <berick> for this, you would want the list to include LONGOVERDUE
2015-04-10T11:57:27  <Bmagic> oh, i see
2015-04-10T11:57:51  <berick> you might need to use a separate filters file for auto lost processing
2015-04-10T11:58:15  <berick> which you can specify via a_t_runner.pl command line option
2015-04-10T11:58:59  <berick> --custom-filters=/path/to/custom.json
2015-04-10T11:59:03  <Bmagic> oh, pass the perl file an overrided action_trigger_filters.json file ?
2015-04-10T11:59:16  <berick> yeah
2015-04-10T11:59:16  <Bmagic> I am ok with changing the default file though
2015-04-10T11:59:23  <berick> well, but you may not want to
2015-04-10T11:59:39  <Bmagic> explain
2015-04-10T12:00:34  <berick> if you add LONGOVERDUE back, then longoverdue items might get marked as longoverdue again.  or, more likely, you'll re-process (and evetually ignore) a bunch of circs you don't need to
2015-04-10T12:00:55  <Bmagic> oh jees
2015-04-10T12:01:02  <berick> the validators should prevent anything from getting the full treatment twice.
2015-04-10T12:01:13  <berick> but they'd have to be loaded and tested
2015-04-10T12:01:17  <berick> over and over again
2015-04-10T12:01:28  <Bmagic> so, I need to setup an AT with a grainularity, and pass that cron the special config
2015-04-10T12:01:54  <berick> yes
2015-04-10T12:02:05  <Bmagic> sounds doable
2015-04-10T12:02:09  <berick> the mark-lost event def probably already has a granularity
2015-04-10T12:02:18  <berick> oh, you mean the cron job
2015-04-10T12:02:32  <Bmagic> both, the cron and the AT need to match grainularity
2015-04-10T12:02:50  <Bmagic> so that only the Lost trigger will include LONGOVERDUE
2015-04-10T12:02:50  <berick> yes, it needs its own cron job w/ the mark lost granularity, and --granularity-only applied, and --custom-filters applied
2015-04-10T12:03:00  <berick> right
2015-04-10T12:03:05  <Bmagic> berick++
