2015-04-15T08:32:09  <mrpeters> is a bug fix for the  2.6.3-2.6.4-upgrade-db.sql version-upgrade script still welcome, or has 2.6 gone out of support?
2015-04-15T08:32:24  <mrpeters> it's trying to use "located_uris" and should be "evergreen.located_uris"

2015-04-15T08:34:28  <eeevil> mrpeters: that's due to ye ol' pg_dump backup/restore. the local fixes are: use pg_dumpall, or run this: SELECT evergreen.change_db_setting('search_path', ARRAY['evergreen','public','pg_catalog']);

2015-04-15T08:37:06  <mrpeters> http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.1/html/backingup.html -- clearly that is dated, but the newest version i could find -- maybe a rewrite for later versions would be good for DIG team to include running the change_db_setting function after a restore from pg_dump

2015-04-15T11:28:25  <bshum> That's not negotiating. Negotiating would be more like, "Hmm, how many cookies?"
2015-04-15T11:29:35  <berick> kmlussier: do you really want to be making bacon-beer-cat cookies?
2015-04-15T11:30:15  * collum loves cookies, but doesn't really need cookies. However ginger snaps are a favorite.

2015-04-15T13:26:05  <csharp> hmm - for some reason I added "Safe" as one of the CPAN modules to install on 14.04, but that looks like a core Perl module - any reason why we'd need the CPAN version?
2015-04-15T13:26:42  <csharp> I see that wheezy installs it too
2015-04-15T13:26:58  <csharp> and I pretty much worked from a copy of wheezy's makefile

2015-04-15T13:40:26  <csharp> yep - Safe comes within the perl package on wheezy and jessie - maybe the wheezy version was too old?
2015-04-15T13:41:41  <Dyrcona> Maybe it's a hold over from squeeze or before it was added to the base distribution?
