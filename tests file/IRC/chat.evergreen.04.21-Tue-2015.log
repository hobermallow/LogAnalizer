2015-04-21T11:29:39  <mmorgan> So quiet today! Hate to disturb the silence, but...
2015-04-21T11:29:51  <mmorgan> I have a question about managing report templates.
2015-04-21T11:30:06  <mmorgan> We have some template folders with too many templates.
2015-04-21T11:30:21  <mmorgan> We can't load them all so we can't get to the older ones to select and delete some.
2015-04-21T11:30:33  <mmorgan> Any harm in deleting them from the reporter.template table directly in the db?
2015-04-21T11:31:56  <tsbere> mmorgan: It can be complicated to do so, but not dangerous persay
2015-04-21T11:32:36  <tsbere> mmorgan: You have to remove reporter.report rows that reference the template(s), and reporter.schedule rows that reference the reports. Watch out for still-running recurring reports using old templates ;)
2015-04-21T11:32:56  <tsbere> mmorgan: If you want help with some of that I have dealt with some of that kind of thing recently
2015-04-21T11:33:40  *** bbqben has joined #evergreen
2015-04-21T11:34:05  <mmorgan> So if I attempt to delete a template that has reports and output linked, it will fail?
2015-04-21T11:34:27  <tsbere> Probably. Which is probably going to be most of the templates because nobody likes to clean up their reports and output, so it seems.
2015-04-21T11:35:02  <jboyer-isl> mmorgan: do you really want to delete them if they can't be loaded? You could shift them to a new folder directly in the db
2015-04-21T11:35:13  <jboyer-isl> Or do you know they're "bad?"
2015-04-21T11:36:01  <tsbere> That is a good point. New folder, move them over, and they are still there, reports and output untouched, etc
2015-04-21T11:36:39  <jboyer-isl> Or shift a few at a time, I suppose, so they could be kept/cleaned up later.
2015-04-21T11:36:39  <mmorgan> Hmm. Didn't think about shifting them into different folders. That's probably the best solution!
2015-04-21T11:36:57  <mmorgan> jboyer-isl++
2015-04-21T11:37:25  <mmorgan> So the user can select and delete from the client the ones they no longer need.
2015-04-21T11:37:40  * jboyer-isl would also point out that having an automated cleanup policy in place is very nice. ;)
2015-04-21T11:37:40  *** akilsdonk has joined #evergreen
2015-04-21T11:38:22  <jboyer-isl> mmorgan: yes, so long as you can get the number down to a reasonable level staff can just delete the templates themselves and the system will take care of the reports/outputs.
2015-04-21T11:38:29  <tsbere> mmorgan: If you want a quick query to say "does anyone have these templates scheduled to run later" I can throw one your way
2015-04-21T11:39:35  * tsbere finds that deleting *shared* templates is a PITA, but otherwise deleting from the client is fine.....but MVLC mainly runs with shared templates....

2015-04-21T12:48:18  <DPearl> I understand that use of iframes in the web client for inclusion of the catalog is problematic.  I stumbled across this page http://www.webdeveasy.com/back-button-behavior-on-a-page-with-an-iframe/ which describes some JS code that edits the history stack of a browser to make the browser BACK button do the right thing when iframes are present.  Has anyone looked into this sort of thing?

2015-04-21T14:41:36  <krvmga> when i look at that file, though, it doesn't contain some of the text currently showing in my staff client splash page :(
2015-04-21T14:41:55  <krvmga> i thought i remembered there was a way to look at the page through a web browser
2015-04-21T14:42:02  <krvmga> am i misremembering?

2015-04-21T16:43:15  <Bmagic> Is there a reason that we/I cannot glue the COPY ID from asset::copy in fm_IDL.xml to acq::lineitem_detail.eg_copy_id ?
2015-04-21T16:44:36  <Bmagic> It's connected from acq but not the other way around. This came up when I was wanting a report on circulations of items generated by acq. I can use the lineitem_detail as my source table, but I get thousands of rows for items that were not created from a PO
2015-04-21T16:46:12  <tsbere> Bmagic: Not 100% sure what you are doing, but it may just be an issue of enabling the nullability selection in the template builder.
2015-04-21T16:46:22  *** Dyrcona has quit IRC
2015-04-21T16:54:22  <Bmagic> tsbere: I tried adding those filters, not NULL etc
2015-04-21T16:55:21  <Bmagic> tsbere: The issue is that it's simply not linked. lineitem_detail->eg_copy_id->circulations->count
2015-04-21T16:56:18  <pinesol_green> Incoming from qatests: Test Success - http://testing.evergreen-ils.org/~live/test.html <http://testing.evergreen-ils.org/~live/test.html>
2015-04-21T16:56:20  <Bmagic> so, eg_copy_id doesn't always have a link to circulations. Without a link, it just shows ALL of the eg_copy_id's associated with lineitem_detail. Even when I say lineitem_detail->eg_copy_id->circulations->circ_id is not null etc
2015-04-21T16:57:52  <tsbere> Bmagic: You would need to ensure that each piece of the entire chain was NOT NULL, I think. Not 100% sure, and it is basically time for me to pack up for the day.
2015-04-21T16:58:13  <Bmagic> tsbere: thanks! I will look at that
2015-04-21T16:58:26  <tsbere> Bmagic: I may be able to help you more tomorrow, though.
2015-04-21T16:58:38  <Bmagic> tsbere: thanks, I might hit you up. Have a good evening!
