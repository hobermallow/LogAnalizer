2015-04-24T13:52:05  <buzzy> space planning question for the conference: how many people typically show up at the dev hackfest?
2015-04-24T13:53:12  <berick> buzzy: curious what others say, but I'd guess 20-30 ?
2015-04-24T13:56:14  <bshum> That might be about right.
2015-04-24T13:57:03  <bshum> Some years I think we got as low as 12.
2015-04-24T13:57:09  <bshum> But other years, it got as high as 25-30
2015-04-24T13:57:24  <bshum> So I guess I would venture my guess based more on who's getting rooms on Tuesday :)
2015-04-24T13:58:06  <bshum> Is there a bar we can hang out in? That worked for Vancouver :)
2015-04-24T13:58:13  <bshum> We took over a bar and did hacking there or something
2015-04-24T14:00:09  <csharp> there's a lot of coming and going for some of us in the hackfest
2015-04-24T14:00:22  <buzzy> is there a bar, he asks. <snort>
2015-04-24T14:00:29  <buzzy> yes, yes there are
2015-04-24T14:01:37  <Dyrcona> There is at least the Cebu Lounge. :)
2015-04-24T14:02:12  <buzzy> yeah, and if you head into town, there are innumerable ones.
2015-04-24T14:02:23  <Dyrcona> And, a business center.
2015-04-24T14:02:30  <Dyrcona> bshum meant at the hotel itself.
2015-04-24T14:02:39  <buzzy> but we'll have a room for you guys; we're just trying to figure out which one.
2015-04-24T14:03:05  <buzzy> actually, there's also a starbucks near the hotel
2015-04-24T14:03:08  <Dyrcona> In Vancouver we basically commandeered the hotel bar on a couple of evenings for hacking and other discussions.
2015-04-24T14:05:21  <Dyrcona> In Cambridge we did some late night hacking in the lobby.
2015-04-24T14:05:33  <Dyrcona> But that was outside the context of the hackfest itself.
2015-04-24T14:05:41  <bshum> In Indiana I think we stole a sideroom or something.
2015-04-24T14:06:03  <Dyrcona> Yeah, we did and a hotel employee even entered, said "Excuse me" and left.
2015-04-24T14:06:09  <bshum> Hehe
2015-04-24T14:06:18  <bshum> So any which way, we can be resourceful :)
2015-04-24T14:06:24  <buzzy> yeah, if you include the lounge and lobby, there should be plenty of places where you can do impromptu hacking. we just want to make sure you have a dedicated room on wednesday
2015-04-24T14:06:46  <Dyrcona> But, yeah, I think 20 is a good number to plan for the hackfest.
2015-04-24T14:06:54  <bshum> Sounds good
2015-04-24T14:07:00  <bshum> buzzy++
2015-04-24T14:07:10  <Dyrcona> buzzy++
2015-04-24T14:08:42  <buzzy> mountainview room it is!
2015-04-24T14:39:37  <berick> any particular reason we don't let anything crawl?  http://libmail.georgialibraries.org/robots.txt
2015-04-24T14:41:17  * bshum pushes csharp into the hot seat
2015-04-24T14:42:08  <kmlussier> buzzy: On a related topic, you asked me about the DIG hackfest. Last year was the first year we did the DIG event, and it was in a separate room.
2015-04-24T14:43:46  <kmlussier> But DIG is pretty good at working wherever we can. In past years, yboston and I have worked from the dev hackfest room if we needed to. But, in those cases, then, you wouldn't really advertise it as a separate hackfest.
2015-04-24T14:44:56  <kmlussier> Prior to last year, DIG only had a standard 45-minute meeting, as is done with other interest groups. If we couldn't do a DIG hackfest, then I think we would need meeting space at some other time.
2015-04-24T14:45:08  * kmlussier really liked having a separate hackfest, though.
2015-04-24T14:46:33  <buzzy> we've got the dig hackfest covered, i think. in the morning, it's going to be in the room where the sql class will be held in the afternoon. when the sql class is going on, it'll move to the lounge
2015-04-24T14:54:44  <kmlussier> A questions about the setup at the hackfest. In previous years, I've found that multiple tables work well so that people can work in groups. With the focus on QA, do you think another setup might be warranted?.
2015-04-24T14:55:36  <buzzy> we currently have the room setup "classroom" style, so that should work, but we can ask them to set it up however you want

2015-04-24T15:15:49  <dkyle> dev mtg yesterday mentioned berick's QA page, where is it?
2015-04-24T15:17:48  <kmlussier> dkyle: http://wiki.evergreen-ils.org/doku.php?id=dev:contributing:qa
2015-04-24T15:18:35  <Dyrcona> I was about to say I've got a link to phasefx 's qa report.
2015-04-24T15:18:36  <dkyle> thanks
2015-04-24T15:20:32  <dkyle> buzzy: would you happen to be a mountain biker?
2015-04-24T15:20:34  <Dyrcona> But, I see something else was wanted. :)
2015-04-24T15:21:18  <buzzy> nope, sorry. hiker and kayaker. there are plenty of mountain bike trails around here, though
2015-04-24T15:22:24  <dkyle> Drycona: link would be appreciated too

2015-04-24T16:31:31  <jboyer-isl> berick: re: your earlier Q about robots.txt, I've changed ours to only disallow images and myopac stuff and submitted a sitemap to Google's Webmaster Tools, but I'm not certain they think our list of 1+M pages without any incoming links are crawl-worthy.
2015-04-24T16:32:21  <jboyer-isl> We're up to 19 crawled pages, last I looked. (only 1M+ to go!)
2015-04-24T16:32:38  <berick> jboyer-isl: i was actually asking about the list archives
2015-04-24T16:33:12  <jboyer-isl> Oh, hey, look at me not paying attention. That is a good question, I tend to go to Google before thinking about MarkMail.
2015-04-24T16:34:05  <berick> yeah, especially useful after an email address change, too
