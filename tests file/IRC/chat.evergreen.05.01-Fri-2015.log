2015-05-01T10:22:02  <Dyrcona> I mostly like Unity.
2015-05-01T10:22:28  <bshum> I've gotten used to it over time.
2015-05-01T10:22:32  <Dyrcona> My biggest gripe is the launcher is hard coded on the left. It ought to be movable to the right side without needing a code patch.
2015-05-01T10:23:03  <Dyrcona> Canonical explained why, and their excuse is bull shit: "It makes support easier."
2015-05-01T10:25:28  <jeff> i LOVE that reason!
2015-05-01T10:25:38  <jeff> i'm a HUGE fan of that reason.
2015-05-01T10:26:04  <jeff> especially when it comes to questions like "why can't we change this password?"
2015-05-01T10:29:20  <Dyrcona> That's a great reason until Dmitry brute forces your password.
2015-05-01T10:29:53  <Dyrcona> But, honestly, it's a lazy excuse.
2015-05-01T10:32:20  <jonadab> Not being able to change default passwords is extremely bad.

2015-05-01T12:11:55  <jeff> hrm. php--
2015-05-01T12:13:00  <jeff> somewhere between these two php versions, FILTER_FLAG_NO_RES_RANGE seems to have diverged from documentation.
2015-05-01T12:13:06  <jeff> PHP 5.3.3-7+squeeze24 with Suhosin-Patch (cli) (built: Jan 31 2015 12:32:09)
2015-05-01T12:13:10  <jeff> PHP 5.4.39-0+deb7u2 (cli) (built: Mar 25 2015 08:33:29)
2015-05-01T12:15:03  <jeff> and yes, they "fixed a bug" but didn't update the documentation. nice.
2015-05-01T12:16:07  <Dyrcona> Well, when I see people mention bugs with distro packages, my first thought is did the maintainer or upstream break it.
2015-05-01T12:16:09  <tsbere> jeff: According to a friend of mine there were some false positives fixed at some point. Which would mean the documentation wouldn't need changing. "This wasn't doing what was documented, now it is"?
2015-05-01T12:17:06  <jeff> tsbere: https://bugs.php.net/bug.php?id=53150 is "oh no, FILTER_FLAG_NO_RES_RANGE permits 127.0.0.1!" and the documentation says ``Fails validation for the following reserved IPv4 ranges: 0.0.0.0/8, 169.254.0.0/16, 192.0.2.0/24 and 224.0.0.0/4.''
2015-05-01T12:17:57  <jeff> tsbere: i'm looking to see if they later reverted the "fix"
2015-05-01T12:18:49  * tsbere hasn't had much reason to use that part of PHP lately so isn't all that familiar with it personally
2015-05-01T12:19:18  <jeff> you're the only reason I ran into it just now. ;-)
2015-05-01T12:19:35  <jeff> PHPSIP2 won't connect to localhost because of it -- simple fix.
2015-05-01T12:22:16  <tsbere> as I said, lately. I haven't done much with phpsip2 for a while.
2015-05-01T12:23:00  * tsbere also rarely has phpsip2 talk to localhost, for that matter, even when testing things >_>

2015-05-01T20:20:42  <jonadab> Yes, but most of the activity takes place in the daytime.
2015-05-01T20:20:55  <jonadab> Like, typically 9-4 or so, Eastern time.
2015-05-01T20:22:38  <nuentoter> ty, well curious if i could get a little bit of help
2015-05-01T20:23:18  <jonadab> Go ahead and ask your question.  The worst we can do is not know the answer.
2015-05-01T20:24:17  <nuentoter> ok i semi new to linux but pretty computer savvy, im trying to set up the evergreen server and having issues installing
2015-05-01T20:24:34  <jonadab> What kinds of issues?
2015-05-01T20:25:16  <jonadab> (Installing Evergreen is somewhat more involved than most Linux software.)
2015-05-01T20:25:29  <nuentoter> im not sure of the file structure of where to be putting everything
2015-05-01T20:26:47  <nuentoter> particularly stuck on the makefile it gets up to the "package libemailpearl-send-pearl is not available.." and so on
2015-05-01T20:26:54  <jonadab> Ok.  Evergreen is kind of atypical in that regard.  The usual procedure is to put certain things in /openils that would, for most other software, be expected to be elsewhere.
2015-05-01T20:27:25  <jonadab> Hmm... libemail-send-perl?
2015-05-01T20:27:30  <nuentoter> ok where should /openils be though? i have it in /usr/local right now
2015-05-01T20:27:47  <jonadab> nuentoter: /openils is an absolute location.
2015-05-01T20:27:51  <jonadab> It starts with a slash.
2015-05-01T20:27:59  <jonadab> So it's in the filesystem root.
2015-05-01T20:28:02  <nuentoter> oh ok
2015-05-01T20:28:08  <nuentoter> that should help haha
2015-05-01T20:28:18  <jonadab> That's an atypical place to put things.  Evergreen is... special.
2015-05-01T20:28:34  <jonadab> There's been talk of moving away from that, but for now...
2015-05-01T20:28:50  <jonadab> As for the Perl library, do you have CPAN set up and working?
2015-05-01T20:29:36  <nuentoter> thats what i was confused about, i've only compiled a few things and used the make command once before but everything always goes in /usr/local
2015-05-01T20:30:04  <nuentoter> nope didnt read that it was required
2015-05-01T20:30:08  <jonadab> automake/autoconf normally default to putting things in /usr/local/
2015-05-01T20:30:38  <jonadab> You'll want to get CPAN working, some of the OpenSRF and Evergreen prerequisites require CPAN modules.
2015-05-01T20:30:48  <jonadab> perl -MCPAN -e shell
2015-05-01T20:32:09  <nuentoter> ok its up
2015-05-01T20:32:20  <jonadab> Ok, is it asking you config questions, or is it done with all that?
2015-05-01T20:33:10  <nuentoter> done with that sitting at the cpan[1] prmpt
2015-05-01T20:33:20  <jonadab> I usually go ahead and type "install Bundle::CPAN" at the CPAN prompt; this is not mandatory, but I usually do it.
2015-05-01T20:33:31  <jonadab> (It updates CPAN and a bunch of related modules.)
2015-05-01T20:34:09  <jonadab> Oh, I should probably clarify:  since you were using make, I've been assuming that you already installed build-essential or the equivalent system package.
2015-05-01T20:34:23  <jonadab> So you have gcc and make and all that stuff.
2015-05-01T20:35:03  <nuentoter> our library is looking to switch very soon to evergreen and i'm setting up a left over computer as a test server to check it out and see what will work for us
2015-05-01T20:35:43  <nuentoter> pretty sure most of that can preinstalled on this distro
2015-05-01T20:35:45  <jonadab> Yeah, I'm doing a similar thing to work on migrating our data.
2015-05-01T20:36:14  <jonadab> nuentoter: Oh, could be.  I use Debian, which doesn't install that stuff by default, but the build-essential metapackage depends on all of it.
2015-05-01T20:36:22  <nuentoter> im on debian jessie for first time
2015-05-01T20:36:42  <jonadab> Anyway, once you have CPAN up and going, you can exit it, then try the make step for the dependencies again.
2015-05-01T20:37:07  <nuentoter> ok its doing its thing right now
2015-05-01T20:37:08  *** jihpringle has quit IRC
2015-05-01T20:37:42  <nuentoter> how much of a hassle is it to migrate?
2015-05-01T20:38:04  <nuentoter> we're a pretty small library so im not worried, it will happen :)
2015-05-01T20:38:30  <jonadab> Depends, but in general, different ILSes don't store the data in exactly the same way in the database.  So you have to figure out which fields in your old ILS map to which fields in the new one.
2015-05-01T20:38:39  <jonadab> Some of the fields will be straightforward, others not so much.
2015-05-01T20:39:09  <jonadab> We're kind of small for Evergreen too.  FTE of about fifteen or so.
2015-05-01T20:39:41  <jonadab> About a hundred thousand items in the collection, and about ten thousand registered patrons, 2-3 thousand of whom have checked anything out *recently*.
2015-05-01T20:41:06  <nuentoter> We're in a town of about 2k people lol
2015-05-01T20:41:33  <nuentoter> One head librarian and 2 pt assitants
2015-05-01T20:42:22  <jonadab> Oh, ok.  We're in a city of about ten thousand people.
2015-05-01T20:42:43  <jonadab> But we get a fair number of patrons using the library who live in towns 10 or 20 minutes down the road.
2015-05-01T20:44:16  <jonadab> Our *official* service area is just the city of Galion, but most library funding in Ohio comes from the State, so nobody gets upset about patrons from the next town down the road using the library.
2015-05-01T20:44:56  <jonadab> Our patrons use the libraries over there too, e.g., if they commute to work.
2015-05-01T20:48:01  *** dcook__ has quit IRC
2015-05-01T20:48:23  *** dcook has joined #evergreen
2015-05-01T20:51:23  <nuentoter> ok i just got the same error on the make file after moving everything
2015-05-01T20:51:36  <nuentoter> let me dbl check things are where they are supposed to be
2015-05-01T20:52:35  <jonadab> It's possible that your distribution doesn't have a package for the Perl library that the makefile wants to install.
2015-05-01T20:52:47  <jonadab> In which case, you can probably work around it by using CPAN to install the module.
2015-05-01T20:52:52  <nuentoter> i have /openils/Evergreen-ILS-2.8.0/     and all that that entails   and also   /openils/opensrf-2.4.0
2015-05-01T20:53:21  <jonadab> Wait, are you /building/ in /openils?
2015-05-01T20:53:42  <jonadab> I don't know of any reason why that won't work, but it isn't what I meant.
2015-05-01T20:54:08  <nuentoter> yes
2015-05-01T20:54:22  <jonadab> Hmm...  I think the CPAN command might be "install Email::Send" or something like that.  Not sure about the capitalization.
2015-05-01T20:54:54  <jonadab> What I meant about /openils is that you'll tell the configure script that that's the install directory.
2015-05-01T20:55:17  <nuentoter> oh haha
2015-05-01T20:56:13  <jonadab> For example, step 4, here:  http://evergreen-ils.org/documentation/install/README_2_8.html
2015-05-01T20:56:47  <jonadab> The --prefix=/openils --sysconfdir=/openils/conf there is what I was talking about.
2015-05-01T20:57:06  <jonadab> The OpenSRF install docs have something similar, IIRC.
2015-05-01T20:59:26  <jonadab> Out of curiousity, what ILS would you be migrating from?
2015-05-01T20:59:33  <jonadab> (We've been on Polaris...)
2015-05-01T21:02:48  <nuentoter> wwe've been using winnebago
2015-05-01T21:03:12  <jonadab> Ah, I've heard of that.  I think Crestline used that before they moved to TLC.
2015-05-01T21:03:40  <jonadab> Or, no, wait; I think _Bucyrus_ moved to TLC, and Crestline moved from winnebago to Polaris.
2015-05-01T21:05:51  <jonadab> (Crestline's main library is about half our size; but they also have a branch, and we don't.  Bucyrus is about our size, give or take.)
2015-05-01T21:06:53  <nuentoter> im new to the staff and winnebago is an old outdated clunky system
2015-05-01T21:07:05  <jonadab> Right, winnebago is a full generation out of date.
2015-05-01T21:07:25  <jonadab> When it was current, we were using Galaxy, which was made by the company that later also produced Polaris.
2015-05-01T21:07:56  <jonadab> It probably doesn't even have its data in a relational database.  (Do you have a good way to get the data out?)
2015-05-01T21:11:46  <nuentoter> im not sure to be honest
2015-05-01T21:12:10  <nuentoter> i think i can only export to an excel file
2015-05-01T21:13:19  <nuentoter> root@debian:/# make -f src/extras/Makefile.install debian-jessie
2015-05-01T21:13:19  <nuentoter> make: src/extras/Makefile.install: No such file or directory
2015-05-01T21:13:19  <nuentoter> make: *** No rule to make target 'src/extras/Makefile.install'.  Stop.
2015-05-01T21:13:42  <jonadab> Hmm, exporting to an Excel spreadsheet should work.
2015-05-01T21:14:18  <nuentoter> didnt mean to paste it all just the command line but isnt that correct?
2015-05-01T21:14:24  <jonadab> nuentoter: are you in the directory where you extracted the tarball?
2015-05-01T21:14:40  <jonadab> The tarball contains a src directory, which contains extras, etc.
2015-05-01T21:15:03  <jonadab> Oh, wait, it puts it all inside of a directory, of course.
2015-05-01T21:15:07  <nuentoter> oh i didnt extract it im just in the dir that contains it
2015-05-01T21:15:09  <jonadab> Like, Evergreen-blah-blah-blah.
2015-05-01T21:15:16  <jonadab> Oh, right, ok.
2015-05-01T21:15:31  <nuentoter> maybe i should sleep instead of doing this late at night lol
2015-05-01T21:15:32  <jonadab> So you tar -xvf Evergreen-whatever.tar.bz2
2015-05-01T21:15:43  <jonadab> Or is it a .tar.gz?  Whatever.
2015-05-01T21:15:58  <jonadab> And then you cd to the directory it creates.  Then do the make step from there.
2015-05-01T21:16:18  <jonadab> Actually, though, you probably want to do the OpenSRF one first.
2015-05-01T21:16:31  <jonadab> Unless you already did.
2015-05-01T21:22:02  <nuentoter> yeah i did opensrf last night the right way i think i just need to walk away from the computer for a bit lol
2015-05-01T21:25:33  <nuentoter> or start taking notes would probably work better
2015-05-01T21:28:15  <nuentoter> there things seem to be finally going correctly i think, time for a cigarette thank you jonadab
2015-05-01T21:31:59  <jonadab> Taking notes is good, yeah.
2015-05-01T21:42:31  <nuentoter> ok so i ran up against the same error with the libemail-send-perl package not being found
2015-05-01T21:42:54  <jonadab> Hmm, maybe jessie doesn't package that one?
2015-05-01T21:43:04  <nuentoter> actually ...
2015-05-01T21:43:07  <jonadab> You can probably work around it by using CPAN to install it directly.
2015-05-01T21:43:19  <jonadab> install Email::Send at the CPAN prompt.
2015-05-01T21:43:54  <nuentoter> it is already installed manually
2015-05-01T21:44:00  <nuentoter> i get this error actually now
2015-05-01T21:44:02  <nuentoter> Package libemail-send-perl is not available, but is referred to by another package.
2015-05-01T21:44:02  <nuentoter> This may mean that the package is missing, has been obsoleted, or
2015-05-01T21:44:02  <nuentoter> is only available from another source
2015-05-01T21:44:17  <nuentoter> before it was not found
2015-05-01T21:44:41  <jonadab> Ok, I'm not certain if this is an actual problem, but if you have Email::Send installed, try just ignoring that error and see if it just works.
2015-05-01T21:45:06  <jonadab> Hmm, wait, one question:
2015-05-01T21:45:23  <jonadab> When doing the make step for the dependencies, you did say debian-jessie for which distro you have, right?
2015-05-01T21:45:32  <jonadab> You didn't, for example, say debian-wheezy?
2015-05-01T21:45:33  <nuentoter> yup
2015-05-01T21:45:37  <nuentoter> jessie
2015-05-01T21:45:46  <jonadab> Ok, so yeah, probably the makefile needs a slight tweak.
2015-05-01T21:45:56  <jonadab> I'll look in launchpad later and see if there's a bug about it.
2015-05-01T21:46:07  <jonadab> It'll be good for me to get familiar with launchpad.
2015-05-01T21:48:27  <jonadab> Ah, this seems relevant.  https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1362260
2015-05-01T21:48:27  <pinesol_green> Launchpad bug 1362260 in Evergreen "Email::Send is deprecated" (affected: 2, heat: 12) [Undecided,Confirmed]
2015-05-01T22:15:22  <jeffdavis> ldw: changes to fm_IDL.xml can go in Open-ILS/examples/fm_IDL.xml; when deploying you need to put the updated file at both /srv/openils/conf/fm_IDL.xml and /srv/openils/var/web/reports/fm_IDL.xml
2015-05-01T22:15:36  <jeffdavis> er, wrong channel
