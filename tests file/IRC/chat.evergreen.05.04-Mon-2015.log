2015-05-04T08:58:41  <mrpeters> morning guys -- i've talked to a few of you about being able to obtain information about the staff member that created a record and many have asked "why?" -- I got an answer, and I think it's a pretty fair one.
2015-05-04T09:01:20  <Dyrcona> AFAIK, that information is only kept for bibliographic records.
2015-05-04T09:02:03  <mrpeters> A library is finding that about 5% of their new patron records are being entered incorrectly (errors in permissions, typos, etc.) and they are trying to identify whether or not this is isolated to 1 or 2 staff members, or spread amongst all staff.  We have creator/editor information for bibs, I think for similar reasons, so I'm going to file a wishlist bug to modify the actor.usr schema to include this information.
2015-05-04T09:02:54  <mrpeters> I should clarify -- i know that is not the ONLY reason that info is kept for bibs, but I'm sure it is one of them
2015-05-04T09:04:14  <mrpeters> as for how to deal with upgrades, i would propose setting the global superuser (au.id=1) as the creator for all records when the upgrade is applied, and then going forward, record the actor.usr.id of the creating staff user
2015-05-04T09:04:39  <Dyrcona> Yeah, put it in the bug. Doubt it would go in soon, though.
2015-05-04T09:05:31  *** Newziky has joined #evergreen
2015-05-04T09:05:51  <mrpeters> yeah, probably not, and they are ok with that -- they realize it was just probably one of those things nobody ever brought up, but as things have evolved, it's become something that would be handy in the future

2015-05-04T09:20:50  <Dyrcona> bshum: I was gonna ask you if there is a git branch for that.
2015-05-04T09:21:10  <bshum> Ah, that thing. Okay, I think that there might be some lingering issue on that step.
2015-05-04T09:21:29  <Dyrcona> Are those the best instructions available?
2015-05-04T09:21:38  <bshum> There used to be a git branch somewhere for that, though I'm not 100% where right now.
2015-05-04T09:22:01  <bshum> More or less, I based them on the README file in the webclient directory.
2015-05-04T09:22:30  <bshum> I'll dig up the branch for you in a bit.

2015-05-04T09:24:18  <bshum> Hmm, I thought I made one but now I can't seem to locate it. I'll make a new branch for you.
2015-05-04T09:26:32  <Dyrcona> One thing that isn't answered by any of the docs is do you do this before installing the rest of Evergreen, or can it be done after?
2015-05-04T09:27:17  <bshum> It's supposed to be before you compile
2015-05-04T09:27:47  <bshum> Otherwise the web client pages aren't in place before you do the configure/make steps
2015-05-04T09:28:04  <bshum> And it doesn't automatically get moved into the installed places during make install
2015-05-04T09:28:18  <Dyrcona> OK. That might explain my problems yesterday.
2015-05-04T09:28:26  <Dyrcona> I'll give it another shot.
2015-05-04T09:29:08  <bshum> Yeah, the position of the instruction in my doc is intentionally if not explicitly defined.
2015-05-04T09:29:17  <Dyrcona> My VM is almost done being created.
2015-05-04T09:29:54  <Dyrcona> Oh. It finished 6 minutes ago. Another window was covering the prompt in the terminal. ;)
2015-05-04T09:30:09  <bshum> You might be right about that npm install needing a sudo on it. I vaguely recall doing something similar at one point.
2015-05-04T09:30:25  <bshum> Though I'm unsure if maybe there were weird permission issue or something.
2015-05-04T09:31:21  <Dyrcona> Well, I got several errors about stuff not being installed/not able to be opened without the sudo.
2015-05-04T09:31:27  <Dyrcona> With sudo, it just worked.
2015-05-04T09:31:59  <bshum> You testing with Ubuntu 12.04 or 14.04?
2015-05-04T09:37:06  <bshum> Alright, so I can't find the branch anywhere, so I must have just been modifying a local copy Evergreen-README on lupin directly. We can diff those changes against master and get a branch started though.

2015-05-04T10:05:39  <Dyrcona> If I'm using OpenSRF from master is there anything that I need to do for the browser-based staff client in OpenSRF?
2015-05-04T10:06:44  <bshum> Dyrcona: I believe the websocket steps were incorporated into the README for OpenSRF master/2.4 series
2015-05-04T10:06:51  <bshum> So you should be fine there as long as that's all setup.
2015-05-04T10:07:12  <Dyrcona> Do you need websockets if I'm not using hatch? I assume yes.
2015-05-04T10:07:17  <bshum> gmcharlt was going to add some samples later on for proxy to get it to run websockets off more traditional ports, or something.
2015-05-04T10:07:34  <bshum> Yes, you need websockets configured or else you won't even be able to log into it.

2015-05-04T11:42:07  <jjk> Good morning
2015-05-04T11:42:25  <jeff> jjk: good morning!
2015-05-04T11:43:25  <jjk> I'm attempting to upgrade an older 2.3 install to the current version but have run into issues with the database schema updates.  I'm hoping some folks here can point me in the right direction.
2015-05-04T11:45:27  <jjk> I have a test database that started at 2.3.5 and I've successfully run the schema updates all the way up to 2.3.12.
2015-05-04T11:47:17  <jjk> When trying to upgrade the schema using 2.3-2.4.0-upgrade-db.sql I quickly receive the following errors:
2015-05-04T11:47:20  <jjk> psql:version-upgrade/2.3-2.4.0-upgrade-db.sql:96: NOTICE:  extension "tsearch2" already exists, skipping
2015-05-04T11:47:29  <jjk> psql:version-upgrade/2.3-2.4.0-upgrade-db.sql:98: ERROR:  cannot drop extension tsearch2 because other objects depend on it
2015-05-04T11:48:41  <jjk> I've not found much in the way of similar issues.
2015-05-04T11:51:19  *** Shirleyh has quit IRC
2015-05-04T11:53:33  <bshum> jjk: So that sounds like you have something custom in your database that relies on tsearch2 extension
2015-05-04T11:54:41  <bshum> I found something like that when we upgraded as well, some locally created views for reporting had used that extension and needed to be rewritten
2015-05-04T11:55:15  * bshum upgraded forever ago and doesn't remember how he ultimately identified all the things that used that extension.
2015-05-04T11:57:35  <jjk> bshum: Thanks.  I'll look at the reports.

2015-05-04T12:01:05  <bshum> jjk: Out of curiosity, what version of PostgreSQL are you using for your tests?
2015-05-04T12:01:17  <bshum> (i.e. did you also test upgrading your postgresql installation to newer versions 9.1+)
2015-05-04T12:02:15  <bshum> And you might find it interesting
2015-05-04T12:02:20  <bshum> To try the drop extension directly
2015-05-04T12:02:37  <bshum> And see if it spits back what is still depending on it
2015-05-04T12:03:25  <bshum> Hmm

2015-05-04T12:04:08  <bshum> csharp: Nevermind, found what I was looking for
2015-05-04T12:04:48  <bshum> jjk: You might see some value in discussion from this mailing list entry: http://list.evergreen-ils.org/pipermail/evergreen-admin/2014-May/000086.html
2015-05-04T12:05:22  <jjk> bshum: I'm running 9.1 on Debian, specifically 9.1.14-0+deb7u1
2015-05-04T12:05:54  <bshum> jjk: Based on what they say there, I would check to make sure the search_path is set right, and then see if there's any "DETAIL" that comes up after the "ERROR" part when you try to drop the extension.
2015-05-04T12:05:59  <bshum> ~search_path
2015-05-04T12:05:59  <pinesol_green> After restoring a database, make sure to reset the search_path accordingly with something like: alter database unpredicable_haxxors_go_away set search_path = evergreen, public, pg_catalog;
2015-05-04T12:08:03  <jjk> Thanks, I'll look these.
2015-05-04T12:08:50  <bshum> jjk: As you work upwards in versions, I want to point you towards http://docs.evergreen-ils.org/2.7/_upgrade_the_evergreen_database_schema.html
2015-05-04T12:08:58  <bshum> Which describes the path you'll want from 2.5+
2015-05-04T12:09:25  <bshum> Specifically, you might want to skip over certain numbered scripts to avoid conflicts in the upgrade scripts.
2015-05-04T12:09:37  <bshum> Due to x.y.z releases coming out at different times.
2015-05-04T12:10:02  <bshum> i.e. skip 2.5.3-2.5.4 (if you're going to go past 2.5 towards 2.6), etc.
2015-05-04T12:10:22  <bshum> You're not there yet.  But you'll get there, sometime.  And that can be a weird little stumbler.
2015-05-04T12:10:47  <jjk> Does this apply for just 2.5 or 2.6 and 2.7 branches too?
2015-05-04T12:10:58  * jeff somewhat idly wonders if he should expect to be able to make it from gate to shuttle in time to make the noon departure, or if he should plan on the 2:30
2015-05-04T12:11:23  <bshum> jjk: It applies to everything.  I'm not sure how far along 2.3 went after 2.4 came along, etc.
2015-05-04T12:11:50  <bshum> So you might find stuff in later version upgrade scripts that have already happened previously and might not successfully apply or whatnots.
2015-05-04T12:12:22  <bshum> So you'll want to follow the path as best as you can if you want to cut down on the amount of manual intervention you'll need.
2015-05-04T12:12:24  <jeff> hah! wondered why there were two calendar entries for my flights. one i created by hand, the other google created automatically.
2015-05-04T12:12:36  <bshum> I'm unsure how comfortable you are with SQL stuffs.
2015-05-04T12:12:54  <bshum> But if you love SQL, you'll enjoy it.  Or learn to enjoy it?  :\
2015-05-04T12:13:04  <csharp> jeff: you might ask Buzzy or Brent about it - I'm in a similar spot with the 5:00 (final) shuttle
2015-05-04T12:13:23  <csharp> they made it sound like they'd be able to hold it for me
2015-05-04T12:13:49  <jeff> csharp: youch -- 9 minutes

2015-05-04T12:13:54  <csharp> yeah
2015-05-04T12:14:15  * csharp doesn't have a very good backup plan :-/
2015-05-04T12:14:40  <Dyrcona> csharp: Tuesday? You hang around until midnight when bshum and I get there.
2015-05-04T12:14:46  <csharp> ha!

2015-05-04T12:15:27  <bshum> Heh
2015-05-04T12:16:16  <jjk> bshum: clear as mud!  It's not clear to me what is meant by 'run all incremental scripts' if for example 2.4.0-2.4.1 is not an incremental script.
2015-05-04T12:17:24  <bshum> jjk: I think that's exactly what it means.  (And that the doc writer got lazy and meant to say, run 2.4.0-2.4.1, 2.4.1-2.4.2, 2.4.2-2.4.3
2015-05-04T12:17:33  <bshum> Which is three incremental scripts
2015-05-04T12:17:42  <bshum> *three separate
2015-05-04T12:18:02  <kmlussier> csharp: I'm arriving at 5:15, just after the last shuttle. I've hitched a ride with gmcharlt later in the night. I don't know if he has more spots, but you might want to check.
2015-05-04T12:18:12  <jjk> bshum: That's what I thought.  What is meant by 'additional scripts'?
2015-05-04T12:18:17  <Dyrcona> Speaking of upgrade scripts, I have plans to make db_upgrade.pl smarter.
2015-05-04T12:18:43  <jeff> The interesting one will be the return for me -- looks like I'll have 5 hours or so to burn.
2015-05-04T12:18:46  * kmlussier has noticed that csharp and I have very similar flight times next week.

2015-05-04T12:20:40  <jjk> Dyrcona: Is that directed at me?  I looked at db_upgrade.pl breifly but didn't see any mention in the docs and so chickened out.
2015-05-04T12:21:05  <jjk> bshum: The docs read: 'Note that you do not want to run additional 2.5 scripts to upgrade to the newest version of 2.5'
2015-05-04T12:21:13  <bshum> jjk: Right... so...
2015-05-04T12:21:13  <Dyrcona> jjk: No, it's directed in general. db_upgrade.pl won't help you right now, but the changes I have in mind might help you in the future.
2015-05-04T12:21:31  <jjk> got it.
2015-05-04T12:21:40  <bshum> jjk: Gotcha now.  So, let's say there were other scripts like, 2.5.3-2.5.4, 2.5.4-2.5.5
2015-05-04T12:22:07  <bshum> If you ran those, then the script for 2.5.3-2.6.0 (major upgrade) may not (read, *will not*) function seamlessly.
2015-05-04T12:22:18  <bshum> Cause your database would be at the wrong state
2015-05-04T12:22:49  <bshum> And you would end up having to edit the major upgrade script to remove stuff that might have already been applied during one of the other incremental scripts.
2015-05-04T12:23:00  <bshum> Things of that nature.
2015-05-04T12:25:03  <jjk> I think I understand.  Once I get over the 2.3-2.4 hurdle I'll compose a list of sql scripts that I believe should be run.  Can I post the URL to that file here and get a sanity check?
2015-05-04T12:26:10  <csharp> kmlussier: thanks - I'll check
2015-05-04T12:26:31  <bshum> jjk: You can always ask, but I don't promise I'll personally answer if I'm not around later.  (though I'm sure others might chime in, if you're patient)
2015-05-04T12:26:52  <bshum> :)
2015-05-04T12:27:08  <bshum> Upgrading from older versions can be interesting.  And that's where you discover all the quirks.
2015-05-04T12:27:57  <bshum> jjk: Out of curiousity, who are you upgrading?
2015-05-04T12:28:46  <csharp> kmlussier: looks like gmcharlt's car is full - I'll try to get some assurance that the 5:00 shuttle doesn't leave without me ;-)

2015-05-04T12:44:11  <bshum> berick: I'm going through master's server_upgrade doc and getting it updated to reflect path up towards 2.8.1
2015-05-04T12:44:14  <kmlussier> OK, the group working on Evergreen outreach met today and talked about adding a contact email to the handouts we'll be distributing at conferences. I know we already have a feedback@evergreen-ils.org address, but we were thinking info@evergreen-ils.org might make more sense for the people we would be reaching at conferences.
2015-05-04T12:44:29  <kmlussier> Is that something we could have set up?
2015-05-04T12:44:34  <bshum> I'll push that out in a bit and we can get the docs server rebuilt overnight to put up a proper link for 2.8 upgrade path later tomorrow.
2015-05-04T12:45:05  * kmlussier isn't sure if that's a csharp request or a gmcharlt request.
2015-05-04T12:48:35  <gmcharlt> kmlussier: looking

2015-05-04T12:50:15  <gmcharlt> kmlussier: there's no info@ reflector, but I can easily create it given a set of email addresses
2015-05-04T12:51:03  <gmcharlt> or it could be mapped to the set underlying list as feedback@
2015-05-04T12:52:01  <kmlussier> Awesome! I think I like the idea of mapping it with the feedback address because it seems like they serve similar purposes. It really is just a matter of semantics.
2015-05-04T12:52:07  <kmlussier> Who is on the feedback address?
2015-05-04T12:52:18  * kmlussier waves to jeff_
2015-05-04T12:53:16  <csharp> kmlussier: me, dbs and phasefx
2015-05-04T12:53:29  <csharp> it's unfortunately 99.4% spam
2015-05-04T12:53:44  <csharp> which reminds me

2015-05-04T12:53:55  <pinesol_green> kmlussier: The operation succeeded.  kmlussier hates spam.
2015-05-04T12:53:57  <csharp> note to self: set up spam filtering somewhere
2015-05-04T12:54:15  <gmcharlt> csharp: kmlussier: also eeevil
2015-05-04T12:54:23  <csharp> oh? good
2015-05-04T12:55:18  <csharp> kmlussier: the other 0.6% are questions that would be better asked on Open-ILS-General (or even of specific sites' Helpdesks)
2015-05-04T12:55:20  <gmcharlt> coins, sides, two
2015-05-04T12:56:12  <gmcharlt> kmlussier: in fact, there'd be an argument to be made that info@ should be publicized *only* on printed materials
2015-05-04T12:56:26  <kmlussier> csharp: Yeah, I think I heard that was the case. But if we were distributing the address in handouts at conference, it might get more use.
2015-05-04T12:56:37  <kmlussier> gmcharlt: So that we could have an informational address that doesn't receive so much spam?
2015-05-04T12:56:46  <gmcharlt> kmlussier: right
2015-05-04T12:57:02  <kmlussier> gmcharlt: In that case, it might be better to separate it out from the feedback address, right?
2015-05-04T12:57:03  <csharp> I think filtering is the only reasonable approach to the spam issue
2015-05-04T12:57:21  <csharp> any address that is public anywhere is subject to that
2015-05-04T12:57:46  <gmcharlt> and conveniently, open-ils-general already has filtering :)
2015-05-04T12:57:48  <csharp> if'n y'all want, I can get awitter on the case ;-)
2015-05-04T12:58:02  <Dyrcona> Even ones that aren't public, you should see all of the unknown address bounces in my logs. :)
2015-05-04T12:58:02  <csharp> he's a seasoned veteran of such things
2015-05-04T12:58:15  <jeff> info@ is going to get spam even if it's only on printed materials.
2015-05-04T12:58:44  <kmlussier> Good point
2015-05-04T12:58:49  <csharp> I'm pretty sure list.evergreen-ils.org has filtering on it too

2015-05-04T13:11:07  <bshum> I'm editing up the various pages on the wordpress site too, to move things onto the "more staff clients" downloads page, and get rid of all the 2.5 stuff and put it onto the code museum page.
2015-05-04T13:11:09  <bshum> Lots of editing.
2015-05-04T13:14:35  <bshum> I suppose I should copy all the 2.6 stuff to the museum too in preparation for that going away.
2015-05-04T13:14:38  <bshum> Since I'm editing anyways
2015-05-04T13:30:27  <bshum> I'm kicking OpenSRF 2.2 off the screen from http://evergreen-ils.org/opensrf-downloads/  No currently supported Evergreen target it, so we can safely remove it.
2015-05-04T13:41:53  <Stompro> bshum++, I was just thinking of working on the upgrade docs for 2.8, thanks.

2015-05-04T14:24:22  <Dyrcona> jeffdavis: You can't use the master branch with Evergreen at the moment.
2015-05-04T14:24:57  <Dyrcona> rangi or someone (me?) has to do some integration. I changed the interfaces a good bit.
2015-05-04T14:25:19  <kmlussier> Dyrcona: I was just looking for that. Is the Evergreen side of it available somewhere else?
2015-05-04T14:25:39  <Dyrcona> It's in the better_abstraction working branch.

2015-05-04T14:27:06  <Dyrcona> magnus over in #koha on oftc.net has apparently made his own branch for more internationalization or something to do with how NCIP is being used in Norway.

2015-05-04T14:27:51  <jeffdavis> FWIW we're not planning to use it at the moment, I'm just anticipating some questions about third-party integration with EG.
2015-05-04T14:27:53  <bshum> Oy, the new ejabberd.yml config file layout is freaking me out.
2015-05-04T14:28:19  <Dyrcona> jeffdavis: Lovely thing about NCIP, you need a new implementation for just about every vendor.

2015-05-04T14:33:37  <Dyrcona> Well, I don't even really consider NCIP to be a standard myself. It's list of features that you can implement.
2015-05-04T14:34:27  <Dyrcona> And every vendor seems to pick their own way to do things, and too many messages are similar, but different.
2015-05-04T14:34:54  <Dyrcona> So, yeah, we need an actual standard.
2015-05-04T14:35:08  <Dyrcona> Where there's one way to do a given task.
2015-05-04T14:35:12  <bshum> Stompro: Well, after I fix up some asciidoc weirdness in the formatting.
2015-05-04T14:35:36  <Dyrcona> If TCP/IP were standardized like most library standards, we'd all be using AOL/CompuServe.
2015-05-04T14:38:21  <jeffdavis> heh
2015-05-04T14:38:48  <jeffdavis> Someone should add that to pinesol_green's quote repository.

2015-05-04T15:24:10  <Bmagic> if I wanted to manually change a password in the database, I need to sha1? md5?  update actor.usr set passwd=digest('password', 'sha1') where id=926  ??
2015-05-04T15:24:25  <tsbere> Bmagic: None of the above?
2015-05-04T15:24:27  <bshum> Bmagic: Nah, there's a DB function that'll do that for you
2015-05-04T15:24:38  <tsbere> Bmagic: set passwd = 'new password' ;)
2015-05-04T15:24:44  <Bmagic> oh, lol
2015-05-04T15:24:48  <bshum> Bmagic: You can just do UPDATE actor.usr SET passwd = 'something' WHERE id = sillyuser;
2015-05-04T15:24:58  <Stompro> bshum, it took me a while to add the second example to the docs also... I thought I compiled it and tested how it looked, did you not like how it looked or did it break when you tried it.
2015-05-04T15:24:58  <bshum> and the function will hash it out for you
2015-05-04T15:25:15  <Bmagic> great! that worked
2015-05-04T15:25:22  <bshum> Stompro: I was just trying to see if I could make it more consistent looking with the rest of the styling.
2015-05-04T15:25:33  <bshum> Stompro: Your approach isn't wrong, just different.
2015-05-04T15:25:45  <bshum> For myself, I might put the OS ahead of the Ejabberd version in the subheadings
2015-05-04T15:26:16  <bshum> So like "(Debian Jessie) Ejabberd 13.x and 14.x" instead of "Ejabberd 13.x and 14.x, Debian Jessie"
2015-05-04T15:26:31  <bshum> That seems to be how everything else is done.
2015-05-04T15:26:59  <bshum> Then when I tried to make it the bold blue text with the .inlead, then I got weird generation errors with the bullets under each section.
2015-05-04T15:27:07  <bshum> Still playing with it more
2015-05-04T15:29:20  <Stompro> I wasn't quite sure with all the numbered steps how to best add in the different options, while continuing the numbering after those steps.  I think I remember that trying to use ".section" headings broke all the numbering afterwards.
2015-05-04T15:29:35  <bshum> Yep, that's what I'm seeing too.
2015-05-04T15:29:51  <bshum> I'm wondering next if we have to number it at all, and maybe we can get away with bullets instead.
2015-05-04T15:33:35  <Stompro> I don't have a strong opinion on it, but don't the docs generally use numbed steps for most things.
2015-05-04T15:34:27  <Dyrcona> Can you get "a" and "b" on the numbers? like 4.1a 4.1b
2015-05-04T15:34:46  <Dyrcona> Or maybe something like X.Y option A X.Y option B
2015-05-04T15:35:06  <Dyrcona> But, seriously if there are options, don't go past C, 'cause people just get confused at that point.
2015-05-04T15:44:35  <mmorgan> I'm puzzling over some strange catalog searches in our logs. Wonder if anyone has seen searches similar to the following ...
2015-05-04T15:44:42  <pastebot> "mmorgan" at 64.57.241.14 pasted "Curious catalog search" (217 lines) at http://paste.evergreen-ils.org/50
2015-05-04T15:45:40  <mmorgan> The searches have a random string of characters for author, title, etc, and have multiple languages and filter groups selected.
2015-05-04T15:46:01  <bshum> Sounds like a very entertaining advanced search.
2015-05-04T15:46:16  <mmorgan> I see a fair number of similar searches in the logs.
2015-05-04T15:46:18  * bshum doesn't know anything, is just musing
2015-05-04T15:46:39  <mmorgan> Heh. "Entertaining" for sure ;-)

2015-05-04T15:56:20  <bshum> Well it is a geographic search for "asia" so, I dunno.....
2015-05-04T15:56:47  <bshum> subject|geographic[Asia]
2015-05-04T15:56:48  <bshum> Whee
2015-05-04T15:58:08  <mmorgan> And some of them don't seem to have any 'real' search terms in them at all. Just the random characters and the limiters.
2015-05-04T15:58:35  <bshum> Yeah, (-"OQcYe" && title:-"2scg4") && author:-"V3oH2") doesn't seem quite... real looking at all.
2015-05-04T15:59:05  <kmlussier> They look like passwords
2015-05-04T15:59:53  <tsbere> Or some of the random negations someone might use to do a "not cached' search
2015-05-04T16:00:34  <bshum> mmorgan: Have you tried tracing back into apache what leads to these queries?
2015-05-04T16:00:43  <kmlussier> Ah, that's true. I do thsoe sometimes. But usually you have a real keyword with those negations.
2015-05-04T16:01:12  <bshum> kmlussier: Well, keyword: subject|geographic[Asia] seems real to me.
2015-05-04T16:01:18  <bshum> If a bit broad.
2015-05-04T16:02:25  * kmlussier isn't looking at the queries closely enough.
2015-05-04T16:04:07  <mmorgan> bshum: How would I go about that?
2015-05-04T16:04:46  <bshum> Well I would have gone with time.
2015-05-04T16:05:07  <bshum> Like, before the timestamp of the DB query, what happens in apache, osrfsys, etc.
2015-05-04T16:05:22  <bshum> And slowly try recontructing the actual thing that made that weird query
2015-05-04T16:06:18  <mmorgan> Ok, I have done some poking around, but haven't been able to pin anything down.
2015-05-04T16:06:54  <mmorgan> Our logs are very busy :)

2015-05-04T17:18:37  <bshum> I give up on the asciidoc syntax for now.  I will slay that eventually though.
2015-05-04T17:18:54  *** mmorgan has left #evergreen
2015-05-04T17:21:38  <bshum> So, for the Evergreen bugs targeting issues with Debian Jessie
2015-05-04T17:21:48  <bshum> I'm thinking to backport those to rel_2_8 and rel_2_7
2015-05-04T17:22:04  <bshum> Since both of those versions contained support for Jessie as a target.
2015-05-04T17:22:16  <bshum> And likely require those fixes to work successfully.
2015-05-04T17:23:08  <Stompro> That makes sense to me.

2015-05-04T17:29:26  <bshum> dbwells: I'm not going to add a 2.6 milestone unless we determine more work is to be done for that series.
2015-05-04T17:29:42  <dbwells> bshum: sounds good
2015-05-04T17:33:53  * bshum shakes fist at Launchpad for timing out

2015-05-04T18:08:54  <bshum> Hmm
2015-05-04T18:10:44  <bshum> Looks like we'll need to create a file for 000.english.pg94.fts-config.sql
2015-05-04T18:10:58  <bshum> In order for PG 9.4 to be used when creating the database
2015-05-04T18:11:10  <bshum> To test, I've just copied the 93 one to be named 94 and seeing how that goes.

2015-05-04T18:30:53  <pinesol_green> Launchpad bug 1445150 in Evergreen 2.7 "Debian Jessie includes Postgresql 9.4 - update software dependency makefile" (affected: 1, heat: 6) [Medium,Triaged]
2015-05-04T18:31:14  <bshum> When we get time, someone else should check that initial working branch, and then make any special adjustments.
2015-05-04T18:31:48  <bshum> Otherwise, as far as I can see, I have a functional Evergreen install on Debian 8.0 Jessie

2015-05-04T19:05:31  <dcook> kmlussier: The last cookies I had from jcamins at a conference were a bit squished... but yummy!
2015-05-04T19:06:09  <dcook> Oh man... I forgot that it's spring/summer in North America...
2015-05-04T19:15:24  *** buzzy has quit IRC
2015-05-04T19:27:02  <kmlussier> dcook: The calendar says it's spring, but I don't think the weather has been paying attention to the calendar.
2015-05-04T19:27:11  <kmlussier> Although the last few days have been quite nice.
2015-05-04T19:28:33  <dcook> Yeah, it's supposed to be autumn/winter here, but I think it's supposed to be something like 26 today
2015-05-04T19:28:45  <dcook> This has to be one of the weirder years I've been in Oz...
2015-05-04T19:42:38  <jonadab> Where I come from, 26 is a nice brisk fall day.  (Granted, that's 26 F.)
2015-05-04T19:42:55  <dcook> I was waiting for that ;)
2015-05-04T19:44:03  <kmlussier> Heh
2015-05-04T19:45:05  <jonadab> Happy to oblige.

2015-05-04T20:03:22  <jcamins> kmlussier: how far is the conference?
2015-05-04T20:03:42  <kmlussier> jcamins: All the way across the country. Hood River, Oregon
2015-05-04T20:03:46  <jcamins> And how many cookies?
2015-05-04T20:03:48  <jcamins> Hm.
2015-05-04T20:04:38  <kmlussier> I don't know how many yet. I'm thinking I may make bshum and his crew get theirs at another time. Since they aren't that far away from me.
2015-05-04T20:04:59  <kmlussier> I offered to make them for Evergreen sites that partnered with us on development projects.
2015-05-04T20:05:13  <kmlussier> The conference seemed so far away back then.
2015-05-04T20:05:17  <bshum> kmlussier: So in other words I'll probably never get cookies
2015-05-04T20:05:28  <jcamins> Are you checking any luggage?
2015-05-04T20:05:29  <kmlussier> bshum: Of course you'll get them!
2015-05-04T20:05:39  <kmlussier> Yes, I was planning to pack it in the checked luggage
2015-05-04T20:05:49  <kmlussier> I didn't know if I could get them through security.
2015-05-04T20:05:55  <kmlussier> How many do you usually travel with?
2015-05-04T20:06:10  <kmlussier> bshum: When you get yours, they probably won't be squished.
2015-05-04T20:06:13  <jcamins> I'd probably bring 4-5 takeout containers with cookies, then.
2015-05-04T20:06:32  <kmlussier> What kind of takeout containers do you use?
2015-05-04T20:06:42  <jcamins> The cookies dcook had were squished because I wasn't checking a suitcase, so I put them in ziploc bags, the better to fit them in my single carry-on.
2015-05-04T20:06:51  <kmlussier> Ah.
2015-05-04T20:06:52  <jcamins> My favorite are the rectangular Chinese ones.
2015-05-04T20:07:01  <bshum> I had those cookies, didn't I?
2015-05-04T20:07:27  <jcamins> *The cookies dcook and bshum had...
2015-05-04T20:08:38  <jcamins> Of course, if you really need to bring a *ton* your best bet is fudge.
2015-05-04T20:08:52  <jcamins> Though you'll spend hours wrapping it.
2015-05-04T20:09:01  <kmlussier> Fudge is yummy.
2015-05-04T20:09:19  <kmlussier> But I haven't made it in years.
2015-05-04T20:10:40  <jcamins> I make cheating fudge.
2015-05-04T20:11:00  <kmlussier> I don't really need to bring that many. There's PINES, COOL, and rfrasur's library. Since I've already decided that Bibliomation can wait.
2015-05-04T20:11:15  <jcamins> Yeah, true. PINES is really small.
2015-05-04T20:11:39  * dcook is getting hungry now but it's only 10:11am...
2015-05-04T20:11:47  <kmlussier> Yeah, that's what people always say when they talk about PINES. It's so small!
2015-05-04T20:11:49  * dcook needs to figure out when Aussies take tea...
2015-05-04T20:12:03  <jcamins> dcook: 10, 11...
2015-05-04T20:12:16  <jcamins> Oh, hey, it's 10 11, time for tea!
2015-05-04T20:12:27  <dcook> hehe
2015-05-04T20:13:15  <dcook> I could actually really go for some hummus about now...
2015-05-04T20:15:15  <jcamins> I should eat some dinner...
2015-05-04T20:15:20  <jcamins> kmlussier: isn't it a bit late for you?
2015-05-04T20:15:53  <kmlussier> Yeah, I'm suffering the consequences of my procrastination.
2015-05-04T20:16:06  <kmlussier> I have a presentation to deliver at 8:30 a.m. tomorrow.
2015-05-04T20:16:33  <bshum> Can you fit chocolate in your presentation
2015-05-04T20:16:35  <bshum> ?
2015-05-04T20:16:49  <bshum> I think that always makes things better.
2015-05-04T20:17:07  <kmlussier> Chocolate at 8:30 a.m.?
2015-05-04T20:17:26  <bshum> True, might be too early for most.
2015-05-04T20:19:22  * bshum might just be thinking about chocolate cause he wants some right now.

2015-05-04T20:23:57  <jcamins> jonadab: any kind of chocolate, really.
