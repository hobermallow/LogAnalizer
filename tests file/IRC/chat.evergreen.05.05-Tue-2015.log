2015-05-05T09:17:51  * csharp is suddenly convinced that lib_ips.txt needs to be moved to the DB
2015-05-05T09:18:28  * tsbere has never used that feature
2015-05-05T09:20:35  <csharp> for the unfamiliar, if your org_unit's shortname, start of IP range, and end of IP range is in that file (/openils/conf/lib_ips.txt), and the OPAC redirector is uncommented in /etc/apache2/eg_startup, the server will redirect the request to search that org_unit's collection
2015-05-05T09:21:23  <csharp> it's a plain text file, but I'm now convinced that there's no reason no to put that in the DB so libraries can manage it themselves
2015-05-05T09:21:36  <csharp> s/reason no/reason not/
2015-05-05T09:21:44  <tsbere> We use subdomains and rewrite tricks. <_<
2015-05-05T09:22:26  <csharp> that would be far less manageable at our scale
2015-05-05T09:22:48  <csharp> 54 systems, ~340 units
2015-05-05T09:23:10  <dbs> we use subdomains and rewrite tricks too.
2015-05-05T09:24:51  <tsbere> csharp: Specifically, the rewrite tricks define "this subdomain means this code" (we have some codes used multiple times) and "this code means this physical location" in text files.
2015-05-05T09:24:55  <tsbere> It isn't that hard to maintain.
2015-05-05T09:25:41  *** remingtron has quit IRC
2015-05-05T09:25:56  <jeff> it changes the maintenance from "libraries should be sure that central systems staff have all of their client IPs on file" to "libraries should set this as their homepage url"
2015-05-05T09:26:29  <jeff> but it doesn't handle the case of "patron got here via other means (manual url entry, following a link, search results) and we'd like them to receive special treatment based on their ip"
2015-05-05T09:26:31  <csharp> hmm - I'll have to ponder that
2015-05-05T09:26:43  <jeff> (because you do kinda' need their IP to do that kind of thing)

2015-05-05T09:27:00  <jeff> barring a proxy that you control that does interception and header insertion, etc, etc.
2015-05-05T09:27:09  <csharp> we've been a monolithic "gapines.org" for so long - I would have to be convinced enough to convince others it's worth the trouble
2015-05-05T09:28:30  <csharp> in any case, moving the IPs into the database sounds like a low overhead solution for our current approach
2015-05-05T09:28:59  <csharp> I have definitely wondered in the past if anyone else out there even uses the lib_ips.txt feature
2015-05-05T09:30:05  <csharp> it would also be nice to configure SIP accounts in the DB and not require us to edit XML
2015-05-05T09:30:28  * csharp points out that he is not on the most recent version of SIPServer or the newer sip config
2015-05-05T09:30:45  <jeff> we used to use it.

2015-05-05T09:37:23  <tsbere> csharp: I can somewhat agree on some of the SIP stuff, though I think the way things work in the XML would be hard to translate to DB storage right now.
2015-05-05T09:38:04  <tsbere> Might be easier to rig up a DB table with needed info and then rig something to dump the relevant config file lines from it.
2015-05-05T09:39:30  *** maryj has joined #evergreen
2015-05-05T09:46:06  <jeff> i'm not sure i'd favor SIPServer reading config from a db. i would favor things that would make reconfiguring it easier -- i'm not actually certain that it hadn't recently gained an easier way to do a kind of graceful reload/restart.

2015-05-05T09:49:43  <jonadab> You could always have the firewall ruleset redirect each library's IP range to a different port, then use Apache virtual server stuff to engage rewrite tricks from there.

2015-05-05T11:54:26  <yboston> Hello everyone, DIG will need access to a test server running 2.8.x, I suspect we may be able to use webby? Any other recommendations?
2015-05-05T11:55:22  <tsbere> yboston: kmlussier may be willing to spin up one of the masslnc test boxes for ya, though those don't get the web client going currently.
2015-05-05T11:55:41  <yboston> tsbere: thanks
2015-05-05T11:56:13  <kmlussier> yboston: The server on the community servers page already has 2.8. But, as tsbere said, it doesn't have webby.
2015-05-05T11:56:26  <kmlussier> I usually use webby for web client docs.
2015-05-05T11:57:36  <yboston> kmlussier: my bad I misread what version the mlnc4 server was running
2015-05-05T11:57:56  <kmlussier> I forgot to equate the date with a version. I usually do that.
2015-05-05T11:58:07  <yboston> kmlussier: I think we are all set
2015-05-05T11:58:08  <kmlussier> I'm guessing 4/6 was 2.8.0ish?
2015-05-05T12:00:22  <tsbere> Wouldn't take long to re-build it if we want. I could do so for you if you want.

2015-05-05T13:41:15  <csharp> uhhh - so apparently accented characters (such as é), which we don't check for in our email regex, result in a broken email address in EG
2015-05-05T13:43:02  <jeff> "broken email address" in the sense that a single patron doesn't receive notification, or something else?
2015-05-05T13:46:59  <tsbere> non-compliant email address due to localpart issues I assume
2015-05-05T13:52:03  <Dyrcona> Yep. Non-compliant.
2015-05-05T13:52:26  <bshum> csharp: So Dyrcona and I are flying in like 10 pm or something crazy late.
2015-05-05T13:52:44  <bshum> If you're still at PDX, we can bring you along then.
2015-05-05T13:53:48  <csharp> bshum: thanks for the offer.  I may end up needing a rental
2015-05-05T13:54:08  <bshum> Sure, just saying.
2015-05-05T13:54:14  <csharp> :-D
2015-05-05T13:55:06  <Dyrcona> Header field bodies have to contain US-ASCII characters, but it could be encoding for a special character, like a URL escape format.
2015-05-05T13:55:34  <Dyrcona> Trouble is, how a local-part of the email address works is left up to the recipient server.
2015-05-05T13:56:47  <Dyrcona> And that explains some of the gibberish spam I get from China. :)
2015-05-05T13:59:30  <csharp> é ends up looking like Ã© in this particular case
2015-05-05T14:06:09  <jeffdavis> "ends up looking like" in what display context?
2015-05-05T14:07:07  <csharp> I'm looking at a screenshot that appears to be from Outlook
2015-05-05T14:07:31  * csharp goes to the logs to see exactly what happened
2015-05-05T14:09:18  <Dyrcona> jeffdavis: My guess is in an ISO-8859-1 context. :)
2015-05-05T14:09:48  <jeffdavis> Dyrcona: technically a correct answer :)
2015-05-05T14:12:20  <Dyrcona> Possibly Windows 1252....
2015-05-05T14:12:31  <Dyrcona> ;)
2015-05-05T14:12:48  <jeffdavis> If someone entered a UTF-8 é in the email address during patron reg, I'd expect it to display correctly within EG (although this may be naive of me), but perhaps get garbled when mail is sent.
2015-05-05T14:13:53  <Dyrcona> jeffdavis: I would expect more or less the same, but it depends on XulRunner getting the right character set information from the PC and possibly the server as well.
2015-05-05T14:23:35  <csharp> yeah - the postfix log shows ?? in place of the é character
2015-05-05T14:23:49  <csharp> it was rejected as a syntax error
2015-05-05T14:24:44  <csharp> btw, both the patron name and email address displays fine in the staff client, fwiw
2015-05-05T14:28:40  <dbs> csharp: you might not be using the email templates that include helper escape functions?
2015-05-05T14:29:26  <dbs> We had that problem initially, which is why I went through that process
2015-05-05T14:30:03  <dbs> https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1031335 I think?
