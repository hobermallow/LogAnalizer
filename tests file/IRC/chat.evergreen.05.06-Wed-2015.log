2015-05-06T09:38:22  <kmlussier> Maybe we should name our Evergreen releases.
2015-05-06T09:38:50  <kmlussier> Actually, I take that back. The last thing I want to do is enter into another discussion that might lead to the release numbering debate again.
2015-05-06T09:39:23  <bshum> What? No "Amazing Acorn" for 3.0?
2015-05-06T09:39:33  <mmorgan> Oh, I was going to suggest 'widdlepuppy' for the first named release:)
2015-05-06T09:41:46  <kmlussier> bshum: Don't you think we should pick something more Evergreen-ish as opposed to deciduous?
2015-05-06T09:42:22  <bshum> If Ubuntu can use fake animals like Unicorns and Werewolves, then I don't know what to believe.

2015-05-06T09:49:59  <dbwells> When I was RM, I thought about starting a practice of naming releases after after pop/rock tunes.  2.5 would have been "Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da", 2.6 would have been "Let It Be", and 3.0 will of course be "Stairway to Heaven".

2015-05-06T13:32:56  <csharp> okay, so we're interested in getting the OPAC translated into Spanish, and I'm looking at the Launchpad translation tools...
2015-05-06T13:33:43  <csharp> where do these strings come from?  I'm seeing serveral that look like code entries
2015-05-06T13:33:55  <csharp> (as opposed to public-facing text)
2015-05-06T13:34:29  <berick> csharp: sometimes html tags will make their way into the strings.  is that what you're seeing?
2015-05-06T13:34:56  <csharp> example:
2015-05-06T13:34:56  <csharp> (pubdate_clean)
2015-05-06T13:34:56  <csharp> (copyright_clean)
2015-05-06T13:34:58  <bshum> csharp: Sometimes also, the translation is intentionally variabled
2015-05-06T13:34:58  <berick> and some of it is interpolation variables, like [_1] or %$1 or some such
2015-05-06T13:35:08  <bshum> Like how berick says
2015-05-06T13:35:19  <csharp> ok
2015-05-06T13:35:33  <csharp> maybe I need to back up and learn how it works from scratch
2015-05-06T13:35:42  *** buzzy has joined #evergreen
2015-05-06T13:36:02  <csharp> we're hoping to hand this off to a third party who we don't expect to know anything about code or even Launchpad
2015-05-06T13:36:11  <bshum> csharp: So normally, what I would do is to get a PO from Launchpad
2015-05-06T13:36:18  <bshum> And then have them replace strings in the file.
2015-05-06T13:36:24  <berick> so, pubdate_clean is definitely a variable, whose value is inserted into the string after translation
2015-05-06T13:36:25  <csharp> ah
2015-05-06T13:36:26  <bshum> But yeah, those files tend to be a little odd.
2015-05-06T13:36:53  <bshum> mceraso has a long-term project to work on Spanish too, but I'm not sure where she's at with it.
2015-05-06T13:37:09  <csharp> we think it would be a huge win here
2015-05-06T13:37:25  <bshum> It's undoubtly the biggest thing we need to re-achieve.
2015-05-06T13:37:35  <bshum> Spanish JSPAC took us a little bit of work to get done back in the day.
2015-05-06T13:37:46  <bshum> End of the day, having some translations to start is better than none.
2015-05-06T13:37:58  <bshum> And engages new users to help suggest alternatives for the future.
2015-05-06T13:38:04  <bshum> With nothing, it's hard to start at all.
2015-05-06T13:38:12  <csharp> terran is already working with a locally-based translation service on another project, so we're trying to see how many words need translating (as they charge by the word)
2015-05-06T13:38:17  <bshum> So for my money, I'd say, give them the file, ask them to do their best, and see how it goes.
2015-05-06T13:38:34  <bshum> And deal with nuances later on.
2015-05-06T13:38:37  * csharp wishes it was that simple
2015-05-06T13:38:39  <bshum> Ah, gotcha.
2015-05-06T13:38:49  <csharp> we have to create an estimate before we can do anything
2015-05-06T13:38:58  <bshum> I guess I just mean to say perfect isn't to be expected.
2015-05-06T13:39:27  <mceraso> csharp: my initial hesitation was the variations of dialectic
2015-05-06T13:40:04  <csharp> mceraso: you mean dialects?  if so, yeah, I've thought about that too
2015-05-06T13:40:15  <mceraso> Yes, exactly
2015-05-06T13:40:20  <csharp> I would imagine es-MX is proabably our best bet
2015-05-06T13:40:27  <csharp> at least here in Georgia
2015-05-06T13:40:49  <mceraso> I know Castilian Spanish well enough
2015-05-06T13:40:55  <csharp> nice!
2015-05-06T13:40:58  <mceraso> But yeah, looking at what's already there
2015-05-06T13:41:07  <mceraso> es-MX seems more useful
2015-05-06T13:42:14  <mceraso> csharp: when were you looking to have the translation completed by?
2015-05-06T13:43:34  <csharp> mceraso: actually, the conversation right now is "we have leftover funds for this fiscal year and want to spend them as fast as possible", but I'm not sure if that means the actual translation would have to be complete by a certain time
2015-05-06T13:43:43  * csharp hopes not
2015-05-06T13:44:52  <mceraso> Well, I agree that it's definitely something that is needed :)

2015-05-06T13:54:20  <dbs> very exciting that you have a potential fix though!
2015-05-06T13:57:30  <Bmagic> I want to make sure this is not a feature of Evergreen: Patron puts an item on hold from "my lists" and the item is removed from said list
2015-05-06T13:58:00  <bshum> I feel conflicted about that based on what the purpose of a list is.
2015-05-06T13:58:13  <bshum> On the one hand, if I were making a list for stuff to put on hold
2015-05-06T13:58:28  <bshum> I might like it removing it from my list so that I don't try doing another hold on the same thing later.
2015-05-06T13:58:34  <bshum> But if it was just a reading list or whatnot
2015-05-06T13:58:40  <bshum> That seems.... wrong.
2015-05-06T13:58:45  <gmcharlt> dbs: bah, I just noticed I crossed streams; you'll want to also look at 1452366 vis-a-vis the new_editor() changes in init_ro_object_cache
2015-05-06T13:59:03  <Bmagic> so it's not a feature, right?
2015-05-06T13:59:03  <bshum> Maybe not automagically would be the key, I think.  Maybe some sort of prompt or user setting to make that happen.
2015-05-06T13:59:11  <bshum> Bmagic: I don't know.  :)
2015-05-06T13:59:25  <bshum> One person's feature is another person's bug?  Or so the saying goes?
2015-05-06T14:00:14  <bshum> Bmagic: Are you asking because it's doing this on your system now?  Or are you asking whether it's an idea someone else has and would be cool to have as a new feature of the future?
2015-05-06T14:00:29  <Bmagic> the ladder
2015-05-06T14:00:38  <bshum> Oh, then that's different.
2015-05-06T14:00:39  <bshum> :)
2015-05-06T14:00:51  <bshum> And you ignore my whole "is it a bug? is a feature?" spiel
2015-05-06T14:01:23  <bshum> My opinion then is that if you want to make that a thing, I'd make it an option for users to enact if they opt into it.
2015-05-06T14:01:39  <bshum> Just because I'd rather not make that the default action.
2015-05-06T14:01:44  <bshum> But others may have other opinions.
2015-05-06T14:01:55  <Bmagic> bshum: yeah, it should be a setting if such a thing existed
2015-05-06T14:03:47  <bshum> Bmagic: What might be good is to describe the idea for a new feature like that and send it out on the list for feedback.
2015-05-06T14:04:03  <bshum> I imagine there might be lots of helpful ideas from staff / evergreen users.

2015-05-06T15:31:44  <jwoodard> Ok weird question.
2015-05-06T15:32:45  <jwoodard> More so a n00b question. How do you filter out barcodes that are inactive in reports? Say if you give a patron a new card and the old card is marked inactive.
2015-05-06T15:39:48  <jeff> depends on what you're reporting on
2015-05-06T15:40:14  <jeff> but typically, the library cards in actor.card can be filtered on "active" being true or false.
2015-05-06T15:42:13  <tsbere> jwoodard: If you want just their "current" barcode you want to go off of the "card" entry on actor.usr, instead of the "all barcodes" IDL link.
2015-05-06T15:42:33  <tsbere> (given that a single user may have multiple "active" barcodes, but they can only have one "primary")
2015-05-06T15:42:34  * jeff nods
2015-05-06T15:43:13  <csharp> jwoodard: what tsbere said is probably what you're after

2015-05-06T20:46:35  <_whitni> Hi All - wondering if anyone might be able to give me some insight as to what I missed for the ./configure
2015-05-06T20:49:16  <jihpringle> _whitni: the channel is usually very quiet at this time of day.  Between 9am and 5pm Eastern Standard Time there is more likely to be someone who can help you
2015-05-06T20:49:31  <jihpringle> you could also try one of the mailing lists: http://evergreen-ils.org/communicate/mailing-lists/
