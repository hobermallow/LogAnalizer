2015-01-02T10:20:46  <Dyrcona> When looking at running queries in an Evergreen database, ones that have hash values for table names are run by the reporter, correct?
2015-01-02T10:21:47  <jeff> i can't remember without looking if QP uses that trick anywhere
2015-01-02T10:22:10  <jeff> but i can confirm that the reporter does generate those kinds of table aliases -- that probably doesn't help you much :-)
2015-01-02T10:22:21  <Dyrcona> OK. I've got one of the queries running for about 5 minutes now, and there are two clark kents going, one says reporting.
2015-01-02T10:22:35  <Dyrcona> I'll assume this is the report.
2015-01-02T10:27:05  <Dyrcona> Yep. The query finished and the reporting clark kent vanished.

2015-01-02T13:20:24  <remingtron> berick: bshum: I'm looking to install the web client. Is the staff/README.install file in master the latest? I recall bshum trying to flesh it out, but don't see that in the history.
2015-01-02T13:21:19  <gmcharlt> remingtron: it's the latest AFAIK; what bshum had been working on IIRC was the OpenSRF websockets README
2015-01-02T13:21:40  <gmcharlt> in any event, the process described in staff/README.install works
2015-01-02T13:21:56  <remingtron> gmcharlt: ah, thanks, that sounds right
2015-01-02T13:22:18  <bshum> i did start a branch for the main README too
2015-01-02T13:23:19  <berick> see also bug 1392759 for automating the prereq installs
2015-01-02T13:23:19  <pinesol_green> Launchpad bug 1392759 in Evergreen "Developer/Packager Makefile.install targets" (affected: 1, heat: 6) [Wishlist,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1392759
2015-01-02T13:24:53  <berick> though, it's probably easier just to use the README.install for now
2015-01-02T13:25:09  <bshum> remingtron: Yeah looks like I didn't push a git branch yet, but I apparently did create a generated version at http://evergreen-ils.org/~bshum/Evergreen-README.html#_optional_extra_steps_for_browser_based_staff_client
2015-01-02T13:25:21  <bshum> I'll look around on my laptops, one of them probably has the working branch
2015-01-02T13:25:30  <bshum> I think I wanted to flesh out the position of the instructions better
2015-01-02T13:25:43  <bshum> Since it only pertains to developers who use the git installs
2015-01-02T13:25:53  <bshum> The tarballs already compile things.  Now, anyways.
2015-01-02T13:28:54  <remingtron> bshum: thanks for the info!
2015-01-02T13:32:23  <remingtron> bshum: did you you also push a branch for opensrf install instructions w/ websockets? or is that the missing branch you mentioned?
2015-01-02T13:32:29  <berick> remingtron: it's in opensrf master
2015-01-02T13:32:29  <bshum> remingtron: That was definitely already done, and is part of OpenSRF master
2015-01-02T13:32:41  <bshum> It's only a matter of when gmcharlt cuts 2.4.0 official :)

2015-01-02T13:33:29  <bshum> So yeah, the staff/README.install is the main thing to follow for the moment.
2015-01-02T13:33:45  <remingtron> thanks, that's what I'll do then
2015-01-02T13:39:23  <bshum> remingtron: On a different note, I have it on my very long list of to-do to finish looking over the changes you and Stompro were poking at for 2.7 upgrade doc changes in https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1390138

2015-01-02T13:40:15  <bshum> Oy.
2015-01-02T13:40:15  <berick> bshum: this is where I would add the '2.8' series?  https://launchpad.net/evergreen/+addseries
2015-01-02T13:40:24  <bshum> I think so
2015-01-02T13:40:33  <bshum> Looks right anyways
2015-01-02T13:40:43  <berick> k
2015-01-02T13:40:52  <bshum> Yes.
2015-01-02T13:41:21  <bshum> berick++
2015-01-02T13:41:54  <berick> bshum: do you have a tool for updating bugs from targeting 2.next to 2.8?
2015-01-02T13:42:24  <bshum> berick: What I did during the last dev cycle was to only move bugs from 2.next to 2.8 as they were actually merged / worked on.
2015-01-02T13:42:34  <bshum> That way, we didn't churn unnecessarily to move everything back from 2.8 to 2.next if we missed them
2015-01-02T13:42:44  <bshum> So 2.next is a perpetual milestone.
2015-01-02T13:43:02  <bshum> As far as moving things, no, I've always just manually changed things in LP.
2015-01-02T13:43:35  <berick> gotha
2015-01-02T13:45:45  <Dyrcona> I used to have a script, but it quit working after a LP udgrade a couple of years ago.
2015-01-02T13:45:50  <bshum> Based on that interpretation, I might suggest changing some bugs to no longer target 2.next (since they were bug fixes that have been released in 2.7 series) and just mark them as fix released with no milestone shuffle to 2.8.x
2015-01-02T13:46:07  <bshum> If it would help, I'd be happy to do some bug triage for you berick.
2015-01-02T13:46:56  * berick wonders if we should just have a milestone called "pullrequest" 
2015-01-02T13:47:08  <berick> bshum: i would not say no to that :)
2015-01-02T13:47:12  <bshum> Maybe "newfeature"
2015-01-02T13:47:13  <bshum> :)
2015-01-02T13:47:24  <bshum> pullrequest for bugs vs. newfeatures are different to me
2015-01-02T13:47:52  <berick> oh, right, because 2.next would only be features
2015-01-02T13:49:10  <berick> bshum: regarding the 2.7 vs 2.next bugs, if they were merged into 2.7, wouldn't they be marked as 'fix committed' for 2.next anyway?
2015-01-02T13:49:24  <bshum> berick: Correct.
2015-01-02T13:49:38  <bshum> But for LP purposes then, you'd have lingering bugs that never close cause 2.next will never release
2015-01-02T13:49:56  <bshum> So we end up moving those bugs from 2.next to an actual release milestone 90% of the time anyways
2015-01-02T13:50:39  <berick> i see.  just wondering what makes more sense.. marking 'released' on a virtual milestone (2.next) seems kind of odd, no?
2015-01-02T13:50:52  <bshum> It's pretty pointless.
2015-01-02T13:51:14  <berick> haha
2015-01-02T13:51:14  <bshum> What I am doing right now is removing the milestone link for the main line
2015-01-02T13:51:14  <bshum> And marking the bug as fix released
2015-01-02T13:51:15  <bshum> Which will hide it from active listed bugs
2015-01-02T13:51:15  <berick> ah, ok
2015-01-02T13:51:18  <bshum> And not have it linked to the 2.next milestone anymore
2015-01-02T13:51:57  <bshum> This is my general interpretation of a way to use LP.  We can discuss it further at the January dev meeting maybe.
2015-01-02T13:51:59  <berick> another possibilty.. rename '2.next' to 'master'.  equally as pointless, but more flexible going forward
2015-01-02T13:52:02  <bshum> And solidify our approaches
2015-01-02T13:52:08  <berick> sure
2015-01-02T13:52:50  <berick> and thanks, bshum
2015-01-02T13:53:30  <bshum> berick: Once you have a 2.8.0-alpha milestone (or beta?) let me know
2015-01-02T13:53:41  <bshum> I can shuffle along bugs that are fix committed in 2.next to the proper place for 2.8
2015-01-02T13:53:52  <berick> k, doing so now
2015-01-02T13:55:39  <berick> bshum: do you know what "date targeted" means in the milestone creation form?
2015-01-02T13:55:47  <berick> release date, perhaps
2015-01-02T13:55:53  <bshum> berick: That's sort of an estimated date for when you release, yes.
2015-01-02T13:56:11  <berick> cook
2015-01-02T13:56:11  <berick> er, cool
2015-01-02T13:56:11  <berick> we're cookin!
2015-01-02T13:56:11  <bshum> I tend to target those to the date I plan to cut, or maybe +1 day
2015-01-02T13:56:29  <bshum> I think some people use +1 day (gmcharlt seems to have?) and it seems smart to do so since LP seems to live in a different timezone.
2015-01-02T13:56:49  <bshum> Close enough though :)
2015-01-02T13:56:59  <gmcharlt> bshum: uh... yeah... that's why I seized on that date... that's right...
2015-01-02T13:57:00  <gmcharlt> :)
2015-01-02T13:57:16  <bshum> gmcharlt++ # you're just that cool ;)
2015-01-02T13:57:54  <berick> heh
2015-01-02T13:57:59  <berick> ok, created 2.8-beta
2015-01-02T13:58:08  <bshum> berick++ #cool, retargeting
2015-01-02T13:58:23  <berick> bshum++
2015-01-02T14:00:11  <bshum> Okay, all settled.
2015-01-02T14:00:13  <bshum> For now.
2015-01-02T14:00:19  <bshum> The real work begins though ;)
2015-01-02T14:03:58  <berick> indeed
2015-01-02T14:06:43  * berick wonders if 78 pullrequest bugs is high
2015-01-02T14:07:29  <bshum> That sounds like a lot.

2015-01-02T17:07:07  <berick> ugh.  on more than one box (ubuntu 14.04), retrieving file /reports/fm_IDL.xml via browser craps out w/ an IDLCHUNK parse error.
2015-01-02T17:07:33  <berick> it reads "\x1f\x8b\b" as the first few bytes..  (which is of course not in the IDL).
2015-01-02T17:07:53  <berick> mod_idlchunk.c might need a once-over.
2015-01-02T17:07:59  <berick> cofirmed same with mod_xmlent
2015-01-02T17:08:08  <berick> wonder if anyone is having the same problem...
2015-01-02T17:15:51  <jeffdavis> berick: we saw that error during our 2.4 and 2.6 upgrades, let me see if I can dig up details
2015-01-02T17:16:20  <berick> jeffdavis++
2015-01-02T17:16:28  <berick> good... hope i'm just missing something
2015-01-02T17:20:10  <dbs> berick: usually that's a sign that the translation is not complete
2015-01-02T17:20:34  <berick> dbs: the fm_IDL.xml file itself is fine.  xmllint linkes it OK
2015-01-02T17:20:40  <berick> er, likes it
2015-01-02T17:20:59  <jeffdavis> yeah, just confirmed that our issue was translation related so probably not the same problem
2015-01-02T17:21:01  <dbs> berick: sure, but if there's a new type (like 'aou') that doesn't exist in the entity-ized version, then crap out
2015-01-02T17:21:12  <jeffdavis> in our case we had added an entry to the IDL (to add a link from holds to hold_copy_map in the reporter) but hadn't done the proper localization stuff; our workaround was to overwrite reports/fm_IDL.xml with the version at /openils/conf/fm_IDL.xml which is hardcoded in English
2015-01-02T17:21:47  <berick> more to the point.. on my system, /openils/var/web/reports/fm_IDL.xml was copied directly from /openils/conf/fm_IDL.xml
2015-01-02T17:21:53  <berick> IOW, it has no entities
2015-01-02T17:22:07  <dbs> berick: oh, that's certainly a different matter then.
2015-01-02T17:22:18  <berick> dang
2015-01-02T17:23:09  <dbs> proper localization stuff == 'cd build/i18n; make LOCALE=xx-YY newpot updatepo; make install' before doing the regular build and install
2015-01-02T17:23:41  <dbs> otherwise, you have to copy the updated i18n files into place manually
2015-01-02T17:25:43  <berick> dbs: thanks.  been meaning to figure out how to do that when installing from source.
2015-01-02T17:25:54  * dbs would love to get rid of mod_xmlent and all of the .properties bits of i18n
2015-01-02T17:26:25  <dbs> Interesting, https://laurentian.concat.ca/reports/fm_IDL.xml works fine but http://laurentian.concat.ca/reports/fm_IDL.xml gives a heinous error on our SSL-everywhere-ish instance
2015-01-02T17:27:28  <dbs> "unable to include "/opac/locale/${locale}/fm_IDL.dtd" in parsed file /openils/var/web/reports/fm_IDL.xml" the error log says (ubuntu 12.04 here)
2015-01-02T17:28:21  <berick> yeah, that's definitely different
2015-01-02T17:29:32  <jeffdavis> berick: is your fm_IDL.xml being gzipped by apache?
2015-01-02T17:29:53  <jeffdavis> apache deflate or whatever
2015-01-02T17:29:54  <berick> jeffdavis: ooh.. i like that
2015-01-02T17:29:57  <berick> lemme see
2015-01-02T17:30:07  <dbs> jeffdavis++ # that rings a bell too
2015-01-02T17:31:21  <dbs> We had disabled that combination way back when in the apache 2.2 config because of that problem, but I think the compression config might have been touched recently?
2015-01-02T17:32:24  <berick> jeffdavis++
2015-01-02T17:32:26  <berick> that's it

2015-01-02T17:36:39  <dbs> Looks like the OOB compression config is still the same
2015-01-02T17:37:06  <berick> had to change /etc/apache2/mods-enabled/deflate.conf to get it to work w/ deflate enabled
