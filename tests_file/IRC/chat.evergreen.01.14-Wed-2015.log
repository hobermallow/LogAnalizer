2015-01-14T09:20:52  <Stompro> @later tell Ghid0rah There are several ways to debug action/triggers.  You can take a look at the tables under action_trigger.* to see what is being processed.  You can take a look at /openils/var/log/osrfsys.log while running action_trigger_runner.pl to see exactly what is happening.  You can also add the --verbose argument to action_trigger_runner.pl to see more details of what it is doing.
2015-01-14T09:20:52  <pinesol_green> Stompro: The operation succeeded.
2015-01-14T09:22:47  <tsbere> He could probably place a copy hold for himself with email notification turned on, then check the copy in, then wait to see if he got an email too. :P
2015-01-14T09:23:27  <tsbere> (though depending on what the state of configuration is that may not provide a lot of info as to what is wrong if it doesn't show up)

2015-01-14T10:50:09  <kmlussier> When a change is made to one of the templates in action_trigger.event_definition, do any other changes (roll bricks, etc) need to be made in order for the new event_definition code to take effect?
2015-01-14T10:50:23  <kmlussier> The change in question is to the PO JEDI template.
2015-01-14T10:52:11  <tsbere> kmlussier: I don't believe anything else has to be done. Though obviously already-fired events won't use the new template.
2015-01-14T10:52:56  <kmlussier> Yup. This would have been a new event.
2015-01-14T10:53:00  <kmlussier> Thanks tsbere!

2015-01-14T17:20:50  <aubjordan> When creating a report that is pulling info on transited items is it possible to not have it pull info on items that have completed its transit?
2015-01-14T17:21:59  <aubjordan> I hope that makes sense
2015-01-14T17:22:47  <eeevil> aubjordan: yes, just filter for dest_recv_time (I don't recall the label) is NULL
2015-01-14T17:23:05  *** mllewellyn has quit IRC
2015-01-14T17:23:11  <eeevil> that will get you transits that have not yet arrived
2015-01-14T17:26:31  <aubjordan> I keep forgetting about NULL
2015-01-14T17:29:14  *** mmorgan has left #evergreen
2015-01-14T17:29:21  <aubjordan> What I am seeing is different though.
2015-01-14T17:30:06  <aubjordan> I ran a report looking a for all transits over a given time frame. What I am trying to filter out is those that are no long in transit or at another library.
2015-01-14T17:31:31  <aubjordan> Im thinking it may be two separate reports.
