2015-01-20T09:21:34  <krvmga> in our opac, in the advanced search screen, our format filters box has suddenly is no longer populated. i don't know why.
2015-01-20T09:24:43  <kmlussier> krvmga: What should be populating that box? The default formats that shipped with Evergreen 2.5 or did you have search filter groups there?
2015-01-20T09:24:52  <kmlussier> krvmga: Also, I see a similar problem on your basic search page.
2015-01-20T09:25:13  <krvmga> kmlussier: we're wondering if autogen needed to be run after some work that was done over the weekend
2015-01-20T09:25:19  <krvmga> we're doing that now
2015-01-20T09:25:57  <krvmga> kmlussier: we have a custom config for the format filter box that points to the format_filters that we use.
2015-01-20T09:27:03  <kmlussier> krvmga: So I'm guessing that would be search filter groups since you aren't on an MVF release yet?
2015-01-20T09:27:33  <krvmga> kmlussier: yes, we aren't on an MVF release yet. and yes, it's search filter groups
2015-01-20T09:28:11  <krvmga> apparently some changes were made to fm_IDL.xml over the weekend but i didn't think that would mess this up.

2015-01-20T09:40:33  <Dyrcona> Hmm. Probably a syntax problem somewhere, but I don't know where to look off the top of my head.

2015-01-20T09:47:45  <csharp> eeevil: I don't see it in the activity log :-(
2015-01-20T09:48:03  <eeevil> you've managed to convince QP to pass a []-enclosed string all the way down to the db, it seems

2015-01-20T09:48:23  <csharp> eeevil: I'll look into it and let you know
2015-01-20T09:49:01  <eeevil> I'll bet it's something like "programs for children series_title[PBS Kids]"

2015-01-20T09:51:59  <dbs> Possibly horribly sparse visible browsable results for that one library?
2015-01-20T09:52:45  <eeevil> csharp: it doesn't look like you currently have series|series_title set as a facet, but someone is probably using either a bookmark or maybe the kpac to add that to searches.  You'll need to add that back as a facet
2015-01-20T09:53:15  <eeevil> or stop using it in links ... which is not easy, of course

2015-01-20T09:55:58  <eeevil> dbs: they sure can ... but this happens to not be arbitrary ;)
2015-01-20T09:56:12  <dbs> We could maybe be defensive, load up the configured facets / OUs / search fields and filter before passing on to the db I guess
2015-01-20T10:00:44  <eeevil> dbs: we do that ... but obviously not well enough for all cases
2015-01-20T10:06:12  * dbs clearly needs to step through the constituent parts of metabib.browse() to find the bottleneck
2015-01-20T10:07:24  <krvmga> does autogen clear the cache on the server?
2015-01-20T10:08:34  * krvmga wondered if the format filters not displaying was a cache problem after autogen was run a little while ago
2015-01-20T10:09:37  <kmlussier> krvmga: I was just looking back on logs when I encountered a similar problem. At the time, reloading apache loaded the search filter groups.
2015-01-20T10:10:04  <krvmga> thanks. we can try that.
2015-01-20T10:10:05  <kmlussier> In my case, the entries weren't displaying immediately after I created the filter groups.
2015-01-20T10:10:28  <kmlussier> It seems odd that it would need to be done again for existing filter groups.
2015-01-20T10:11:04  <krvmga> yes, it does seem odd. but maybe it's worth a try.
2015-01-20T10:13:42  <kmlussier> krvmga: Also, reading further down in the log where reloading apache was recommended, I see it didn't fix the problem. :-/
2015-01-20T10:14:01  <krvmga> kmlussier: pooh
2015-01-20T10:14:45  <Dyrcona> krvmga: autogen does not clear the cache on the server.

2015-01-20T10:16:27  * krvmga sees strong positive value in not destroying all the logged in sessions. :)
2015-01-20T10:18:05  <mmorgan> krvmga: I recall a few cases in the past where we have seen the same problem with an empty format box. Sadly, I can't offer a solution, but we did find that the problem went away overnight. Seems to suggest a caching problem somewhere.
2015-01-20T10:19:02  <krvmga> mmorgan: thanks
2015-01-20T10:26:14  <krvmga> clearing the server cache: does that mean flushing the memcached server?
2015-01-20T10:26:27  <krvmga> will this not wipe out logged in sessions?
2015-01-20T10:26:50  *** RoganH has joined #evergreen
2015-01-20T10:26:53  <jeff> if you clear/flush memcached, you will invalidate every logged in session.
2015-01-20T10:28:28  *** jwoodard has joined #evergreen
2015-01-20T10:28:35  <krvmga> i'm not sure which cache to clear. :(
2015-01-20T10:37:08  <jboyer-isl> krvmga, you almost never need to clear the memcached cache, but Apache keeps a local cache on each machine that's wiped out on a 'service apache2 restart', and of course staff clients also have local caches. (restart or Admin/Developer menu option to clear)
2015-01-20T10:37:25  <jboyer-isl> That's not to say that either of those things will fix your issue. :(
2015-01-20T10:38:31  <krvmga> jboyer-isl: thanks
2015-01-20T10:39:57  <jeff> jboyer-isl: are you referencing the various in-process mod_perl bits there, or some other more specific "cache"?
2015-01-20T10:44:34  <Dyrcona> Does OpenILS/Application/PermaCrud.pm actually serve any purpose?
2015-01-20T10:45:11  <Dyrcona> I haven't found any other code that uses it, and it appears to create cstore transactions that will not be closed if the code ever is called, at in search_permacrud.
2015-01-20T10:45:14  *** rjackson-isl has joined #evergreen
2015-01-20T10:45:18  <berick> Dyrcona: it's used in a few places (vandelay.js), but it's effectively deprecated
2015-01-20T10:45:50  <berick> +1 to getting rid of it if feasible
2015-01-20T10:46:03  <Dyrcona> berick: Thanks.
2015-01-20T10:46:10  <jeff> vandelay, serials, and... Open-ILS/web/js/dojo/openils/widget/TranslatorPopup.js?
2015-01-20T10:46:34  <Dyrcona> I only checked the other perl modules...
2015-01-20T10:46:51  <Dyrcona> but I didn't check for it as a service.
2015-01-20T10:47:00  <jeff> it's the implementation of the (mostly-deprecated, as berick noted) open-ils.permacrud service.
2015-01-20T10:47:22  *** jwoodard has quit IRC
2015-01-20T10:47:42  <Dyrcona> Yep.
2015-01-20T10:47:58  <jboyer-isl> jeff: Yes. I'm assuming there's some stuff in-memory for the perlmods loaded on apache startup and apache possibly caching things that may have a non-0 cache lifetime. (though there may not be many of those that matter)
2015-01-20T10:48:37  <jeff> jboyer-isl: pretty sure there are a few -- just wanted to make sure you weren't referencing something else :-)
2015-01-20T10:49:22  <berick> Dyrcona: oh, think that's the source of your cstore proliferation?
2015-01-20T10:49:35  <jboyer-isl> Well, I suppose that restarting a large service like apache could cause some FS cache churn, but I wouldn't count on that. ;)
2015-01-20T10:49:54  <Dyrcona> berick: Not necessarily, but I've started checking everything that does xact=>1 with new editor.
2015-01-20T10:50:12  <Dyrcona> PermaCrud has a couple of troubling bits, so it could be contributing.
2015-01-20T10:53:33  <Dyrcona> I'm not finding any open-ils.permacrud calls in the log, except for ones that actually call opensrf.system.echo.atomic.
2015-01-20T10:54:01  <jboyer-isl> LP lets me down again. Does anyone know if you can create a copy location and then immediately create items in it (in the same staff client session)? I was thinking that the xul copy editor may be using the cached list of acpl
2015-01-20T10:54:30  <jboyer-isl> 's from login, not going to the DB each time (like some of the TT2 based interfaces clearly do, since you can see the new locations)
2015-01-20T10:54:55  <jboyer-isl> Basically, do you need to restart the client to create items in a brand new location?
2015-01-20T10:55:18  <Dyrcona> jboyer-isl: I seem to recall that you do have to restart the client.
2015-01-20T10:55:45  <bshum> That sounds right to me too.
2015-01-20T10:55:47  <tsbere> Or at least log out and back in again
2015-01-20T10:56:52  <jboyer-isl> Excellent. that was my assumption, but I wanted to verify it real quick.

2015-01-20T11:11:45  <krvmga> just for the record: rolling our brickheads fixed the problem with format filters not showing up. i'm not sure what caused the problem to begin with.

2015-01-20T11:16:03  <krvmga> additional note, apparently some services weren't started correctly after work done on the weekend.
2015-01-20T11:21:51  <krvmga> start-all was used for drones instead of start-services
2015-01-20T11:22:16  <krvmga> LPT: if you accidentally do start-all instead of start-services, stop-all and start over.

2015-01-20T11:48:05  <bshum> So, some fun this morning with lost and paid status.  It looks like a situation occurred where an item was checked out, went overdue, generated some overdue fines, was renewed (2nd transaction)
2015-01-20T11:48:09  <bshum> Then it went to lost
2015-01-20T11:48:25  <bshum> And when they went to pay off the first transaction's overdues
2015-01-20T11:48:31  <bshum> It might have marked the item as "lost and paid"
2015-01-20T11:48:42  <bshum> Even though the 2nd transaction still has a pending lost bill on it
2015-01-20T11:49:10  <bshum> We're still investigating, but I might be opening an LP on that.
2015-01-20T11:51:00  <kmlussier> Wait, what? They renewed an overdue transaction and it went to Lost? Did I understand that correctly?
2015-01-20T11:51:16  <Dyrcona> They probably renewed a lost.
2015-01-20T11:51:27  <Dyrcona> lost--
2015-01-20T11:51:40  <dbs> Lost was not renewed for another season
2015-01-20T11:51:41  <kmlussier> But you can't renew a lost. You get that terrible error message.
2015-01-20T11:52:00  <Dyrcona> Erm, well, I "fixed" that, IIRC.
2015-01-20T11:52:10  <mmorgan> I read it as the *second* transaction went to lost.
2015-01-20T11:52:30  <kmlussier> Dyrcona: That branch still had bugs in it, so it never went into core.
2015-01-20T11:54:24  <bshum> mmorgan is correct, the second transaction went to lost.
2015-01-20T11:54:31  <bshum> The first one was just renewed, so it should have ended
2015-01-20T11:54:51  <bshum> But paying the overdues on the first transaction caused the item to go into a lost and paid state.
2015-01-20T11:55:04  <bshum> They didn't touch the lost bill or the lost transaction
2015-01-20T11:55:06  <bshum> it is still open
2015-01-20T11:55:20  <mmorgan> Yeah, but did the first transaction get a finish date when it was renewed since there were overdue charges?
2015-01-20T11:55:28  <bshum> That's what I'm checking now
2015-01-20T11:55:45  <bshum> It's from 2014, so it should have.
2015-01-20T11:55:55  <bshum> But "should" is an evil thing
2015-01-20T11:56:30  <dbs> right up there with "in theory"
2015-01-20T11:57:57  *** mnsri_away is now known as mnsri
2015-01-20T11:58:08  <bshum> Huh....
2015-01-20T11:58:23  <bshum> The xact_finish on the first transaction is the date that the item was paid
2015-01-20T11:58:33  <bshum> So maybe it didn't have a proper end date for some reason.
2015-01-20T11:58:38  <bshum> That's super weird.
2015-01-20T11:58:43  <bshum> I thought renewing an item would close the transaction
2015-01-20T11:59:55  <jeff> my understanding is that (barring various bugs over the years both ways) renewing an item with a balance owed will not close the tranaction.
2015-01-20T12:00:20  <jeff> because while the item is indeed "checked in" in the scope of that one circ, there is money owed.
2015-01-20T12:00:21  <bshum> And hmm
2015-01-20T12:00:32  * mmorgan agrees with jeff
2015-01-20T12:00:46  <bshum> Yeah that makes sense I guess...
2015-01-20T12:03:32  <bshum> Well then that sounds like that's how the bug happens
2015-01-20T12:03:49  <bshum> If the transaction is being closed for the first time, because we're finally paying off the fines from a previous transaction
2015-01-20T12:04:00  <jboyer-isl> csharp, I looked through our config and the example files in git, and we don't have any reference to the blocked list. (We don't use it, but I would have set it up, just in case). The only reference to list.txt anywhere is in the crontab.example.
2015-01-20T12:04:01  <bshum> but the item is in a state of "lost" presently (from other later transactions)
2015-01-20T12:04:12  <bshum> And the org unit setting is set
2015-01-20T12:04:17  <bshum> It'll kick the item into "lost and paid"
2015-01-20T12:04:23  <jboyer-isl> I don't know where it's referenced (unles it's hard coded into the client)
2015-01-20T12:04:49  <jboyer-isl> Oh, I suppose so: xul/staff_client/chrome/content/main/menu.js:                        var url = 'https://' + XML_HTTP_SERVER + '/standalone/list.txt';
2015-01-20T12:06:10  <jboyer-isl> So you probably do just need a ln somewhere, unless you've been customizing your clients to do something else.
2015-01-20T12:08:20  <mmorgan> bshum: How long have you had the Lost and Paid org unit setting set?
2015-01-20T12:08:51  *** yboston has quit IRC
2015-01-20T12:08:57  <bshum> mmorgan: I'd have to check our org unit setting history to know exactly, but not longer than the last two months or so
2015-01-20T12:10:10  *** mtcarlson_away is now known as mtcarlson
2015-01-20T12:11:19  <mmorgan> bshum: ok, thanks. We haven't implemented it yet, but will very soon.
2015-01-20T12:11:48  <bshum> mmorgan: I think the biggest gripe we've had so far is that people still want to delete the item from the system.
2015-01-20T12:11:55  <bshum> Especially now that they see it's "lost and paid"
2015-01-20T12:12:13  <bshum> But the permission is still a broad, copy in bad status override
2015-01-20T12:12:21  <bshum> Which would allow them to delete any copy they wanted.
2015-01-20T12:12:32  <mmorgan> We're actually planning on NOT delete restricting the lost and paid status.
2015-01-20T12:13:11  <mmorgan> Book's paid for, and no longer on the patron record, so out it goes!
2015-01-20T12:13:18  <bshum> mmorgan: That's nice, in theory.
2015-01-20T12:13:38  <bshum> If you figure out how to do it without giving staff the ability to delete other materials, like lost, longoverdue, etc. let me know.
2015-01-20T12:13:45  <bshum> I don't think it's granular enough for that.  Yet.
2015-01-20T12:14:37  <bshum> I believe we need further development there to make the permissions more precise to allow for that possibility of deleting a lost and paid copy, but not a lost one.
2015-01-20T12:18:37  <mmorgan> I was planning on changing the restrict_copy_delete flag in config.copy_status to false.
2015-01-20T12:19:04  <bshum> mmorgan: Hmm, that sounds like it might work :)

2015-01-20T12:24:42  *** yboston has joined #evergreen
2015-01-20T12:24:51  <bshum> Dyrcona: I wonder if maybe if we added a check to say, only run the block for marking an item lost and paid if the transaction itself has a stop fines of lost or longoverdue
2015-01-20T12:25:09  <bshum> But that assumes that those transactions will definitely have that status
2015-01-20T12:25:28  * bshum wonders what the status of circs that are manually marked vs. automatically
2015-01-20T12:25:41  <bshum> Or if an item hits maxfines, and then is later marked lost manually
2015-01-20T12:25:55  <bshum> I would think the stop_fines doesn't get substituted in that case.
2015-01-20T12:26:04  <bshum> If there wasn't an automated switchover
2015-01-20T12:29:09  * bshum tries to think of other pitfalls in specifying based on the stop_fines reason.
2015-01-20T12:29:36  <bshum> Circulation and billings are so complicated :(
2015-01-20T12:29:56  <Dyrcona> Yes.
2015-01-20T12:30:00  * mmorgan agrees with bshum :-(
2015-01-20T12:30:17  <csharp> jboyer-isl: thanks - the script runs on the utility server and scp's files to the right location/filename on each brick head - I just hadn't updated my .ssh/known_hosts file so all of them were refusing to connect
2015-01-20T12:31:20  <mmorgan> Seems like there are too many places to look when trying to determine the true status of a transaction.
2015-01-20T12:31:30  <jboyer-isl> I see. I thought your message above meant that you were getting an error when ssh'ing in to the machine, I didn't realize that was the cause of the issue. Makes sense.
2015-01-20T12:32:11  <Dyrcona> mmorgan: And some things happen more than once during a transaction.
2015-01-20T12:32:24  * csharp will have to read this scrollback sometime later
2015-01-20T12:32:35  <mmorgan> Yes, many more times than once ;-)
2015-01-20T12:35:29  <Stompro> mmorgan: I think we have people that pay for items that are lost, then find them later and want a refund.  Would that be a reason to not delete?
2015-01-20T12:36:20  <bshum> Stompro: That'd be mainly a problem if the library then wanted to just start reusing that barcoded material again.
2015-01-20T12:36:29  <bshum> Since the barcode would no longer exist.
2015-01-20T12:36:41  <mmorgan> Stompro: It may be. I should have said in our system :).
2015-01-20T12:37:59  <mmorgan> Refunds are generally not automatic in our libraries.

2015-01-20T12:40:24  <Dyrcona> Once the patrons has paid, it is their book.
