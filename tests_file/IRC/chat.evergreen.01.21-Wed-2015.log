2015-01-21T10:20:12  <Dyrcona> So, I have a question.
2015-01-21T10:20:52  <Dyrcona> In looking into cstoreeditor and "hanging" transactions, I see a lot of code in booking that follows a similar pattern.
2015-01-21T10:21:19  <Dyrcona> Create the cstoreeditor with xact=>1.
2015-01-21T10:21:29  <Dyrcona> Do a search or retrieve or a json query or two.
2015-01-21T10:21:37  <Dyrcona> call cstoreditor->disconnect.
2015-01-21T10:21:57  <Dyrcona> The problem is that disconnect does not rollback the transaction.
2015-01-21T10:22:11  <Dyrcona> I see two possible ways to fix this.
2015-01-21T10:22:45  <Dyrcona> 1. change the booking code to do cstoreeditor->rollback, which does the rollback and calls disconnect.
2015-01-21T10:22:49  <pinesol_green> [evergreen|Dan Wells] LP#1408803 Add 'persist' login type to auth_proxy sample config - <http://git.evergreen-ils.org/?p=Evergreen.git;a=commit;h=7267934>
2015-01-21T10:23:19  <Dyrcona> 2. change cstoreeditor::disconnect to check for an open transaction and do a rollback if it finds one.
2015-01-21T10:23:52  <Dyrcona> Advantage of 1 is it doesn't change cstoreeditor. Disadvantage of 1 is we have more places to change the code.
2015-01-21T10:24:13  <Dyrcona> Advantage of 2 is we change code in one place and have less overall code to change.
2015-01-21T10:24:33  <Dyrcona> Disadvantage of 2 is we change cstoreeditor which gets used in a lot of places.
2015-01-21T10:25:08  <dbs> #2 is generally how database connections are expected to work; if you don't explicitly commit an open transaction, then you should expect it to be rolled back at disconnect time. Normally.
2015-01-21T10:25:14  <Dyrcona> However, it looks like the transaction is actually useless to cstoreeditor after the disconnect, so it seems logical that disconnect should clean up any transactions.
2015-01-21T10:25:19  <Dyrcona> dbs++
2015-01-21T10:25:31  <Dyrcona> or should I say "jinx?"
2015-01-21T10:25:45  <dbs> It's weird that disconnect doesn't actually force the rollback anyway, I guess it doesn't really disconnect at the db level?
2015-01-21T10:26:29  <Dyrcona> dbs: y'know I should look more closely. maybe it does in the c code that cstoreditor eventually calls, but it isn't evident from the perl.
2015-01-21T10:28:04  <Dyrcona> cstoreeditor also has finish, which commits any open transactions, and calls reset. reset calls disconnect.
2015-01-21T10:28:35  <Dyrcona> but commit, calls xact_commit and then disconnect.
2015-01-21T10:28:52  * Dyrcona thinks cstoreeditor could use some attention.
2015-01-21T10:29:52  * tsbere hasn't found an obvious "when opensrf disconnects tell cstore to close down transactions" but, then again, finds the opensrf C code to be convoluted enough that it may not be possible to find something like that at a quick glance
2015-01-21T10:31:35  <Dyrcona> well, disconnect and connect are related to session which appears to only be concerned with OpenSRF sessions and not database sessions.
2015-01-21T10:32:38  <jeff> Unless there are reasons that we're missing as to why you'd ever want the ability to ->disconnect without implicit ->rollback, it sounds like the proposed change to cstoreeditor is the way to go. Nothing preventing a belt-and-suspenders approach of doing 1 also -- almost like taking time to close your file handles rather than leaving it up to the interpreter.
2015-01-21T10:34:28  <eeevil> Dyrcona: that rings a bell... there may be a fix for that already?  in any case, +1 to rollback-on-disconnect

2015-01-21T10:43:23  <Dyrcona> I'll make a new branch and bug then.
2015-01-21T10:44:08  <eeevil> but, I suspect something similar is going on in cstore, because we call void userDataFree( void* blob ) on opesrf-level disconnect, and that does issue a rollback

2015-01-21T11:17:54  <Dyrcona> @later tell eeevil I see where a drone exit will roll back, but I'm not seeing where a disconnect of a cstore session will call userDataFree(). Could you point out what I'm missing, please?
2015-01-21T11:17:54  <pinesol_green> Dyrcona: The operation succeeded.
2015-01-21T11:24:30  <Dyrcona> Ah!
2015-01-21T11:24:57  <Dyrcona> @later tell eeevil Never mind, with tsbere's help, I think I found how that gets set up.
2015-01-21T11:24:57  <pinesol_green> Dyrcona: The operation succeeded.
2015-01-21T11:25:53  <Dyrcona> For the curious, it looks like initSessionCache in oils_sql.c sets the callback to free the data at disconnect time.
2015-01-21T11:26:37  <Dyrcona> So, I should probably focus on cstoreeditors that create transactions and don't disconnect.
2015-01-21T11:27:03  <Dyrcona> However, since I don't like magical code, I'll still add the rollback in cstoreeditor disconnect.

2015-01-21T11:37:59  <berick> to be clear, if either $e->rollback or $e->disconnect are called (in a timely fashion), the cstore drone is free and is no longer contributing to the drone pileup.
2015-01-21T11:38:58  <berick> adding a rollback inside of disconnect won't have any effect on it.
2015-01-21T11:41:07  <berick> if you go that route, though, beware $e->rollback == $e->xact_rollback + $e->disconnect.  IOW, watch out for a disconnect loop.
2015-01-21T11:42:34  <berick> $e->xact_[rollback|commit] are the non-magical versions
2015-01-21T11:43:01  <Dyrcona> berick: I'm aware of that. I was going to do $self->xact_rollback if ($self->{xact});
2015-01-21T11:43:25  <berick> in the end, though, i doubt the cstore explosions have anything to do with cstoreeditor and everything to do with calling code failing to disconnect/rolllback in a timely fashion.
2015-01-21T11:44:07  <Dyrcona> berick: I think it does, and I think specifically it is relates to lines like return new_editor(xact=>1)->search .... in Trigger.pm.
2015-01-21T11:44:27  <berick> Dyrcona: oh, yeah, that's bad
2015-01-21T11:44:36  <Dyrcona> Although, I agree it isn't cstoreditor per se, just some misuse of it.
2015-01-21T11:45:04  <berick> exactly
2015-01-21T11:45:19  <Dyrcona> I'll bet we have the problem 'cause we run triggers on our production server and most others run them on a utility server.
2015-01-21T11:46:05  <berick> that could def. affect it
2015-01-21T11:46:47  <berick> and just to reiterate, nothing you do to CStoreEditor will fix new_editor(xact=>1)->search...  That has to be fixed in Trigger.pm.
2015-01-21T11:49:21  <jeff> is the underlying intent of something (bad, misguided, whatever) like new_editor(xact=>1)->search to effect an "authoritative" search in a pgpool-type environment?
2015-01-21T11:49:37  <berick> jeff: yeah
2015-01-21T11:49:41  <jeff> k.
2015-01-21T11:51:05  <jeff> related, and not currently relevant to me, but istr newer pgpool versions changing behavior such that BEGIN doesn't automatically mean you get the master db -- did we do something to work around that, or is that just a "be sure to configure newer pgpool versions to disable that new 'optimization'"?

2015-01-21T11:53:18  <jeff> http://list.georgialibraries.org/pipermail/open-ils-dev/2011-August/007472.html is the last reference i was able to find (and the first one, actually)
2015-01-21T11:56:25  <Dyrcona> berick: Yep. I'm well aware of that. I think I'll hold off messing with cstoreeditor and focus on Trigger.pm.
2015-01-21T11:57:15  <Dyrcona> It just seems that for the sake of clarity and symmetry, cstoreeditor disconnect ought to explicity roll back, kind of like how commit and rollback explicitly disconnect.
2015-01-21T11:57:33  <Dyrcona> Relying on behavior in the c code seems a bit magical to me.
2015-01-21T11:59:16  <berick> Dyrcona: i'm not opposed to a $e->xact_rollback inside $e->disconnect.  just didn't want you spinning your wheels on something that probably won't help your situation
2015-01-21T11:59:33  <jeff> and /*NO LOAD BALANCE*/ seems to be the magic SQL comment to work around that pgpool-II >= 3.0 behavior

2015-01-21T12:16:37  <Dyrcona> Ah ha!
2015-01-21T12:17:22  <Dyrcona> How's about adding a DESTROY to CstoreEditor, that checks for a xact and a session and does a rollback and disconnect?
2015-01-21T12:17:57  <Dyrcona> If you're managing transactions and objects properly, it should cause no problems.
2015-01-21T12:18:06  <Dyrcona> If you're not, it should clean up your mess.
2015-01-21T12:18:26  <Dyrcona> Then, you can go right on writing sloppy code.
2015-01-21T12:18:30  <berick> Dyrcona: it already has one
2015-01-21T12:19:23  <Dyrcona> It just calls reset.
2015-01-21T12:19:36  <berick> which calls disconnect, which frees the cstore drone
2015-01-21T12:19:39  <Dyrcona> which calls disconnect.
2015-01-21T12:19:42  <Dyrcona> Well, crap.
2015-01-21T12:19:53  <Dyrcona> Then we shouldn't be having this problem, should we?
2015-01-21T12:20:54  <berick> in the case of new_editor(xact=>1)->search, it's not obvious to me when DESTROY would actually get called.
2015-01-21T12:21:43  <berick> but in other cases, where we retain a reference to $e in a long-running function w/o disconnecting, DESTROY won't get called until the $e is out of scope, which could be well after the problem exists
2015-01-21T12:23:08  <Dyrcona> berick in the first case it *should* be called immediately after the return, but Perl's garbage collector might be lazy.
2015-01-21T12:23:42  <Dyrcona> berick most of the long running cases that I've looked at handle the transactions correctly.
2015-01-21T12:24:10  <Dyrcona> Granted, I've not looked at every instance of cstoreeditor use so far.
2015-01-21T12:24:10  <berick> yeah, the lazy garbage collector is my concern there, too
2015-01-21T12:27:24  <Dyrcona> and, relying on garbage collection is relying on magical code that you don't normally control.
2015-01-21T12:37:15  <Dyrcona> In some cases, particularly in booking, the transactions appear to be used to get authoritative data.
2015-01-21T12:37:44  <Dyrcona> It seems it might be a good idea to remove the transactions and have authoritative methods created.
2015-01-21T12:38:09  <Dyrcona> Anyway, that's just a thought for later.

2015-01-21T12:56:43  <eeevil> maybe not. always_xact is only set from auth_wrap, and that has to be set to cause the xact_ed_cache ref

2015-01-21T14:15:19  <Dyrcona> Ah.. here's a question.
2015-01-21T14:15:52  <Dyrcona> What happens to results from a substream search if the transaction is rolled back and the editor disconnected?
2015-01-21T14:16:30  <Dyrcona> S'pose I can write a test program to find out.
2015-01-21T14:18:53  <berick> cseditor does everything synchronously, so you couldn't disconnect/rollback until all results had been retrieved.
2015-01-21T14:19:27  <berick> in which case they're no different than non-substream data
2015-01-21T14:19:33  <Dyrcona> OK/

2015-01-21T15:21:55  <pinesol_green> Launchpad bug 1412893 in Evergreen "Applying lost and paid status at the wrong time" (affected: 2, heat: 10) [Undecided,Confirmed] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1412893
2015-01-21T15:22:43  <mmorgan> bhsum: You're welcome!
2015-01-21T15:28:06  <bshum> I'm contemplating some ways of trying to pin it to only apply closing the transactions on Lost or Longoverdue (the other status)
2015-01-21T15:28:37  <bshum> But I'm just not sure about what if a stop_fines get added before either of those reasons.  For some reason.  But the end result is still some sort of lost thingy.
2015-01-21T15:30:42  <mmorgan> So if a transaction already has a stop_fines reason, and then it's marked lost, doesn't stop_fines get changed to LOST?
2015-01-21T15:31:43  <bshum> That's what I'm not sure of.
2015-01-21T15:31:49  <bshum> I think it doesn't change.
2015-01-21T15:32:07  <bshum> But I might be wrong on that.
2015-01-21T15:32:22  <kmlussier> I thought it did get changed when it's marked as lost.
2015-01-21T15:32:34  <bshum> If so, then that seems like an easy thing to check for in the logic...
2015-01-21T15:32:50  <bshum> Well "easy"
2015-01-21T15:33:15  <mmorgan> Just delared a MAXFINES transaction lost on our training system and the stop_fines changed to LOST
2015-01-21T15:33:45  <kmlussier> But another thing you might want to check is what happens to that stop fines reason when the item is checked in again.
2015-01-21T15:34:11  <kmlussier> I knew the answer to that question a few months ago.
2015-01-21T15:34:12  <tsbere> I believe marking as claims returned will overwrite the lost stop fines reason as well.
2015-01-21T15:34:20  <tsbere> Just as an extra data point
2015-01-21T15:35:16  <bshum> Then I feel better about looking at the stop_fine reason to decide whether to set the lost&paid status

2015-01-21T16:01:09  <gsams> Has anyone had to pull information on merged patrons before?
2015-01-21T16:01:32  <gsams> as in, identify patrons that have been merged over time
2015-01-21T16:02:08  <bshum> gsams++ # trying to help Ashbury with their ILS witchery :\

2015-01-21T16:03:21  <gsams> heh, that one was a single easy part of a much murkier whole.
2015-01-21T16:03:22  <bshum> gsams: If they were merged via the staff client or with the corresponding SQL function, there wouldn't be much evidence of the separate accounts.
2015-01-21T16:03:37  <bshum> How would you identify them as having been merged?
2015-01-21T16:03:44  *** julialima_ has left #evergreen
2015-01-21T16:03:53  <bshum> What are you trying to prove/disprove/gather intel on?
2015-01-21T16:04:03  <gsams> bshum: my assumption would be finding multiple cards referencing the same id from the usr table
2015-01-21T16:04:17  <gsams> but that would also include replacement cards if I'm not mistaken
2015-01-21T16:04:23  <bshum> gsams: Correct.
2015-01-21T16:04:32  <bshum> So that might not be the best indicator.
2015-01-21T16:04:50  <gsams> I think the libraries that are asking are looking for a way to make sure patrons are being merged appropriately
2015-01-21T16:05:24  <gsams> Of course, I felt that the patrons could be easily switched after the fact which would negate the problem entirely
2015-01-21T16:05:40  <Dyrcona> You might also find cases of patrons who legitimately have more than one card, though you can't really do that via the client.
2015-01-21T16:05:52  <bshum> Dyrcona: Well you can now.
2015-01-21T16:06:02  <bshum> I think there's an active toggle on all cards in the client.
2015-01-21T16:06:19  <Dyrcona> I meant more than one active card.
2015-01-21T16:06:34  <RoganH> I can think of lots of reasons for patrons to have more than one active card, especially in consortiums.
2015-01-21T16:07:06  <gsams> We try to avoid that within the group, which I suppose is why this question formed
2015-01-21T16:07:07  <bshum> Dyrcona: Plus I think it's a YAOUS to configure to deactivate / delete cards.  Otherwise, it might keep them all active on the user post-merge?
2015-01-21T16:07:36  <gsams> technically the cards from both of the original records work on the merged record
2015-01-21T16:07:46  <RoganH> So, there are staff level concerns that it's not working correctly?  Because of an incident or because they are concerned about something they haven't observed?
2015-01-21T16:07:51  <gsams> and appear to be active, at least in my experience here
2015-01-21T16:07:59  <bshum> gsams: Well, technically they both retrieve the user, but only the "active" card can be checked out to.
2015-01-21T16:08:12  <gsams> bshum: ah.
2015-01-21T16:08:36  <gsams> RoganH: I think they are concerned that the patron's wishes are not being kept in mind when merging and they wish to double check the work in some fashion
2015-01-21T16:08:36  <bshum> If they're both active, then I think it's the YAOUS
2015-01-21T16:09:17  <gsams> I am unfamiliar with YAOUS
2015-01-21T16:09:26  <bshum> ~yaous
2015-01-21T16:09:26  <pinesol_green> yaous is an acronym for Yet Another Org Unit Setting
2015-01-21T16:09:34  <gsams> ha
2015-01-21T16:09:37  <RoganH> I'd do this as a controlled experiment.
2015-01-21T16:09:51  <bshum> The setting in question being in group Circulation "Patron Merge Deactivate Card"
2015-01-21T16:10:03  <bshum> If that's set to TRUE for a given org unit, it'll deactivate the cards on patron merge.
2015-01-21T16:10:13  <bshum> Otherwise, I think it'll leave any merged cards as active.
2015-01-21T16:10:20  <RoganH> Merge two known accounts and show them the before and after to show them what happens.  I wouldn't put too much research into what sounds like a vaguely defined concern.

2015-01-21T16:11:33  <bshum> If it's unset, I would assume it would leave all barcodes active on the user post-merge
2015-01-21T16:11:53  <bshum> If you set it to TRUE, then only the primary card of the winning account post-merge stays active, other cards are deactivated.

2015-01-21T16:16:19  <gsams> I'm more afraid this is a problem due to poor cataloging than anything else.
2015-01-21T16:16:43  <bshum> gsams: Assuming you mean age in terms of when the material was published... then yeah, probably cataloging is not your friend there.

2015-01-21T19:26:28  <wsmoak> Firefox search widget *and* hold notifications via text message!
2015-01-21T19:27:00  <wsmoak> is there a page of release notes for what got added to PINES ?
2015-01-21T19:30:21  <bshum> wsmoak: only thing I see is http://pines.georgialibraries.org/news-2015-01-upgradevideo
2015-01-21T19:31:06  <bshum> Not sure what else may exist.
2015-01-21T19:31:47  <bshum> In theory, they went from some 2.5 to 2.7
2015-01-21T19:32:30  <bshum> So you could also read the release notes for 2.6 and 2.7 from the Evergreen pages and it'd be a close approximation of new things too.
2015-01-21T19:33:03  <bshum> Though every site implements their own way and may not carry every new feature.
2015-01-21T19:33:56  <bshum> csharp can probably say more, of course ;)
2015-01-21T19:38:35  <wsmoak> thanks bshum.  I think that covers it.

2015-01-21T20:00:12  <dbs> wsmoak: btw, after upgrading to a new version of firefox on a windows machine, it offered a "new search experience" and that seems to align with what you were seeing
2015-01-21T20:01:44  <wsmoak> dbs: the missing icon ?
2015-01-21T20:02:51  <dbs> yeah. maybe a firefox bug
2015-01-21T20:08:26  <dbs> I guess we could add an <Image> element to the opensearch description though
