2015-03-10T08:40:45  <jboyer-isl> Action Trigger Question Time!
2015-03-10T08:42:47  <jboyer-isl> So, by default a_t_r_pl only runs the checkout.due hook because it’s defined as the default in the script. There are a lot of passive hooks though, some of which seem to run without having to be called specifically (the selfcheck.whatever hooks, usually). Do any local hooks have to be added to /openils/conf/action_trigger_filters.json or called out on the a_t_r.pl command line?
2015-03-10T08:43:12  <jboyer-isl> any local == all local...
2015-03-10T08:43:54  <jboyer-isl> I would have assumed that not specifying any hook would mean to run them all, but I am mistaken.
2015-03-10T08:49:21  *** Shae has joined #evergreen
2015-03-10T08:52:16  <jboyer-isl> For the logs: From what I have seen it does appear that local hooks need to be added to action_trigger_filters.json.
2015-03-10T08:53:29  <dbwells> Our experience matches that conclusion.  I haven't seen any passive hooks run other than those we added to action_trigger_filters.json.
2015-03-10T08:54:12  * mmorgan has found that to be true as well.
2015-03-10T08:57:05  <dbwells> We don't run and selfcheck, so I can't comment on whether that code does something unique with event generation.
2015-03-10T09:02:21  <mmorgan> We are running some selfcheck stations that use the a_t selfcheck receipts. Not sure I understand why those events are "passive", but they work just fine.

2015-03-10T09:30:52  <Dyrcona> Do I have to use namespace prefixes when using xpath in a database query on bre.marc?
2015-03-10T09:31:27  <Dyrcona> I ask, 'cause this is giving me nothing: /record/field[@tag="245"]/subfield[@code="a"]/text()
2015-03-10T09:32:05  <Dyrcona> Doh!
2015-03-10T09:32:25  <Dyrcona> datafield, not field.
2015-03-10T09:33:03  <Dyrcona> And, I still get nothing!
2015-03-10T09:33:15  <Dyrcona> It's gonna be another one of those weeks, I see.
2015-03-10T09:33:20  <dbwells> Dyrcona: We usually tiptoe around any possible namespace issues and do something like:  oils_xpath_string('//*[@tag="245"]/*[@code="a"]', bre.marc)
2015-03-10T09:33:42  <Dyrcona> Ok, I'll us oils_xpath_string, then.
2015-03-10T09:33:53  <Dyrcona> I don't like using //*
2015-03-10T09:34:01  <Dyrcona> Just sayin'.
2015-03-10T09:34:05  <dbwells> Well, I think the regular xpath stuff works too with the wildcards.
2015-03-10T09:34:30  <Dyrcona> It does. I just prefer the precision of specifying exactly what I want.
2015-03-10T09:35:39  <dbwells> Yes, that was in response to your first statement, not the stuff about not liking the wildcards.  At some point I just gave in, since @tag is already pretty specific in a marc record.
2015-03-10T09:36:25  <Dyrcona> Still getting nothing, and the record has a 245$a.

2015-03-10T09:41:55  <Dyrcona> Well, to hell wit that, then. I'll just pull the title from some place else. So what if it is in all lower case.
2015-03-10T09:42:11  <csharp> I don't know enough about it to even really troubleshoot
2015-03-10T09:42:13  <Dyrcona> csharp: I normally have no trouble with xpath in Perl, C, or whatever.
2015-03-10T09:42:38  <csharp> I'll clarify: xpath in Evergreen/postgresql
2015-03-10T09:42:40  <Dyrcona> That same statement works with libxml perl.
2015-03-10T09:42:43  <Dyrcona> Heh.
2015-03-10T09:42:57  <Dyrcona> I already feel exhausted, sorry.
2015-03-10T09:43:54  * Dyrcona should've taken a sick day, but then there'd be no tech staff in the office and everyone else would shit their pants if something happened.
2015-03-10T09:55:03  <gmcharlt> verbose, but effective: '/*[local-name()="record"]/*[local-name()="datafield" and @tag = "245"]/*[local-name()="subfield" and @code="a"]/text()'
2015-03-10T09:56:23  <gmcharlt> sadly, Pg's handling of XML namespaces has been... variable
2015-03-10T09:56:28  <gmcharlt> e.g., http://www.postgresql.org/message-id/54E5C0B1.6040001@joh.to
2015-03-10T09:58:58  <dbwells> We're still on 9.1.14, so that might be a factor in why the code I posted has always worked for me.
2015-03-10T10:00:10  *** Newziky has joined #evergreen
2015-03-10T10:00:14  <gmcharlt> dbwells: indeed
2015-03-10T10:00:26  <dbwells> I've also had luck with something like the following (where the "namespace" argument structure can actually be any namespace you want):
2015-03-10T10:00:30  <dbwells> SELECT xpath('/marc:record/marc:datafield[@tag="245"]/marc:subfield[@code="a"]', marc::XML, ARRAY[ARRAY['marc', 'http://www.loc.gov/MARC21/slim']]) from biblio.record_entry where id = 12345;
2015-03-10T10:00:59  <gmcharlt> dbwells: likewise
2015-03-10T10:08:17  <Dyrcona> Yeah. I just gave up and used mrfr. I don't want to spend all morning on it.
2015-03-10T10:19:45  <Dyrcona> On my opensrf.settings issue: I have almost ruled out the hold targeter and a/t runner, but not exactly.
2015-03-10T10:20:31  <Dyrcona> I notice that storage uses SettingsClient quite liberally, so I'm going log every time it is used in storage and fire off a/t runner and the hold targeter and then see what happens.
2015-03-10T10:24:29  <Dyrcona> dbwells: Our Pg server is 9.1, but I was using a 9.3 client, not that that has much to do with anything. :)
2015-03-10T10:25:25  <berick> fyi if there are more than a handful of connections from storage to settings (maybe even just one), I'd be surprsied.  drones should be reading from the local cached version of the config.
2015-03-10T10:25:42  <berick> if you do find a lot, that's news
2015-03-10T10:25:47  <dbwells> Dyrcona: I'm just curious, are you on 9.1.14 or 9.1.15?  Apparently (based on the thread gmcharlt posted), xpath behavior had a significant change at that minor version.
2015-03-10T10:26:07  * dbwells wants to know if all his reports are going to break when 9.1.15 hits production.
2015-03-10T10:27:05  <Dyrcona> Not even 9.1.14.
2015-03-10T10:27:11  <Dyrcona> Earlier than that.
2015-03-10T10:27:23  <dbwells> ok, guess we'll wait and see :)
2015-03-10T10:27:39  <Dyrcona> XML namespaces can be tricky.
2015-03-10T10:27:54  * Dyrcona thinks they were an OK idea that was poorly implemented.
2015-03-10T10:32:16  <Dyrcona> Whee! Gotta love this one: pg_restore: [archiver (db)] COPY failed for table "z3950_index_field_map": ERROR:  new row for relation "z3950_index_field_map" violates check constraint "valid_z3950_attr_type"
2015-03-10T10:32:40  <Dyrcona> Added something to my restore script to shove the table data in after the fact if the table ends up empty.
2015-03-10T10:32:43  <bshum> I'm still not sure why that randomly happens but then doesn't.
2015-03-10T10:32:52  <Dyrcona> I'm not either.
2015-03-10T10:33:10  <Dyrcona> It will happen, and then it won't.
2015-03-10T10:33:39  <Dyrcona> Sometimes happens several restores in a row, some times doesn't. Sometimes seems to alternate.
2015-03-10T10:33:47  <jboyer-isl> bshum: because it is random. If the 2 tables are restored in this order, everything is fine. If it’s the other order, your data is sad.
2015-03-10T10:34:16  <bshum> Sad data makes me feel sad now.
2015-03-10T10:34:23  <jboyer-isl> pg_restore isn’t smart enough to figure out that the check constraint implies ordering
2015-03-10T10:34:32  <Dyrcona> So, if I don't do parallel restore it won't happen.
2015-03-10T10:34:42  <Dyrcona> But, I'm lazy and don't want to wait all day.
2015-03-10T10:34:51  <jboyer-isl> Dyrcona: true, but like you say, it’s super slow.
2015-03-10T10:35:26  <Dyrcona> What's curious, is why just those two tables? Other tables must have similar relations.
2015-03-10T10:35:49  <jboyer-isl> I know there’s a —disable-triggers (or something similar) If there’s a pg_restore option to ignore all constraints until the data is in that might help.
2015-03-10T10:36:26  <jboyer-isl> Dyrcona: I think it’s specified as a check constraint rather than a foreign key, but I haven’t looked in a while.
2015-03-10T10:36:38  <Dyrcona> jboyer-isl: That could be it.
2015-03-10T10:38:16  <jboyer-isl> I don’t think there are lot of check constraints that depend on other tables. (The only ones I can remember have their list of acceptable values right in the check)

2015-03-10T10:53:35  <dbwells> Dyrcona: bshum: jboyer-isl: Regarding the above issue, this looks interesting: http://dba.stackexchange.com/questions/75613/disable-all-constraints-and-table-checks-while-restoring-a-dump/75635#75635  From what that says, a non-immutable check constraint is a no-no, so we should either move it to a trigger or perhaps add a 'NOT VALID' modifier to it (9.2+)
2015-03-10T10:55:07  <bshum> Interesting.
2015-03-10T10:55:45  <jboyer-isl> dbwells: A trigger certainly sounds good. (may still require disabling on restore, but that’s easy enough to do)
2015-03-10T10:57:00  <Dyrcona> Would a simple FK do?
2015-03-10T10:58:31  <dbwells> I think the issue is that the 'name' is not unique in the config table.

2015-03-10T13:26:03  <mmorgan> Most of our stations are touch screens with no keyboard.
2015-03-10T13:29:00  <eeevil> mmorgan: you can make those staff logins last ... a really long time (excepting memcached restarts), but not auto-login
2015-03-10T13:30:54  <eeevil> mmorgan: you know, actually, if you use the auth proxy from 2.6 and before (still in there) and you don't show the URL bar, you could use basic-auth params in the URL
2015-03-10T13:31:07  <eeevil> and that would be auto-login
2015-03-10T13:31:39  <eeevil> but, you'd be putting the staff user and pw into the url, so you want to be /really/ sure patrons can't ever see that
2015-03-10T13:32:13  <jeff> relying on "don't show the url bar" for the security of a staff password might be more risk than you're willing to accept.

2015-03-10T14:07:04  <bshum> I'm tempted to go for broke and take Modern Compatibility, but I keep getting nervous twitches with IE
2015-03-10T14:07:07  <bshum> IE--
2015-03-10T14:07:45  <Dyrcona> IE6 on XP and Java 6 are not compatible even with the intermediate list.
2015-03-10T14:08:13  <Dyrcona> At least, according to SSLLabs
2015-03-10T14:08:38  <bshum> Right.
2015-03-10T14:08:46  <bshum> But I want that dead for sure :)
2015-03-10T14:08:54  <dbs> Intermediate, yes.
2015-03-10T14:08:58  <bshum> I just feel like maybe giving people IE7 might be good.
2015-03-10T14:09:00  <bshum> Stupid Vista users
2015-03-10T14:10:08  <dbs> Yeah, I can't justify breaking IE < 11
2015-03-10T14:10:11  <Dyrcona> I can't imagine how giving anyone IE7 could be good.
2015-03-10T14:10:13  <dbs> So just intermediate.
2015-03-10T14:10:26  <Dyrcona> ;)
2015-03-10T14:10:34  <Dyrcona> I'd go with intermediate.
2015-03-10T14:10:42  <Dyrcona> Or, rather, I did.
2015-03-10T14:10:44  <dbs> And we use HTTPS-only, so Modern would very much break IE < 11.
2015-03-10T14:11:08  <bshum> True that.
2015-03-10T14:11:19  * bshum steps back from the cliff a bit then

2015-03-10T14:27:35  <jonadab> Requiring IE users to upgrade to at least IE8 seems reasonable.
2015-03-10T14:27:51  <jonadab> I think IE8 will install on everything back through XP.
2015-03-10T14:28:07  <Dyrcona> Requiring IE users to switch to Firefox or Chromium sounds reasonable. :)
2015-03-10T14:28:27  <jonadab> Heh.
2015-03-10T14:28:32  <jonadab> Good luck with that.
2015-03-10T14:28:54  <jonadab> Although, a lot of progress has been made.  Die-hard IE-only users are well down into minority country these days, so that's progress.
2015-03-10T14:29:11  <Dyrcona> Just for fun I wrote something that would tell IE users that they couldn't use a site and provided links to download a different browser.
2015-03-10T14:29:33  <jonadab> Oh, I remember when half the sites on the web did that.
2015-03-10T14:29:45  <Dyrcona> I know of some users who don't trust software that didn't come with the computer.
2015-03-10T14:29:51  <jonadab> Back when IE was new and none of the websites had started to support it yet.
2015-03-10T14:30:05  <jonadab> Anything other than Netscape got the "install our favorite browser" button.
2015-03-10T14:30:14  <Dyrcona> Of course, you can't trust the crap that the vendor loaded in the first place.... *Cough* Lenovo *Cough*
2015-03-10T14:30:30  <jonadab> Lenovo is not unique in that regard.
2015-03-10T14:30:36  <Dyrcona> Not by a long shot.
2015-03-10T14:30:44  <jonadab> My normal practice is to not trust software unless I get it from the people who wrote it.
2015-03-10T14:30:48  <Dyrcona> Dell used to put a lot of crap on "home" PCs.
2015-03-10T14:31:04  <Dyrcona> My normal practice is buy with no O/S installed, just the hardware, please.
2015-03-10T14:31:08  <bshum> Remember google chrome frame plugin? Ah, JSPAC... I do NOT miss you.
2015-03-10T14:31:41  <Dyrcona> bshum: Actually, I don't remember that, but I have a very selective memory. :)
2015-03-10T14:31:48  <jonadab> Hah.
2015-03-10T14:32:16  <bshum> :P
2015-03-10T15:02:38  <dbs> bshum: ugh, yes, I remember that

2015-03-10T16:24:55  <Dyrcona> Does $self->method_lookup($method)->run(args) actually make a request or it does it just run the method directly?
2015-03-10T16:26:07  *** rashma is now known as rashma_away
2015-03-10T16:27:27  <Dyrcona> Never mind, I found the answer in OpenSRF::Application, I think.
2015-03-10T16:29:07  <Dyrcona> BTW, OpenSRF perl code appears to be indented with tabs. Just throwing that out there.
2015-03-10T16:29:40  *** rjackson_isl has quit IRC
2015-03-10T16:30:03  <Dyrcona> The answer to my question appears to be "It depends."
2015-03-10T16:30:41  <Dyrcona> Looks like it usually will make an OpenSRF call, but under certain circumstances (i.e. when $self->{remote} is undefined) it will just execute the code.
2015-03-10T16:31:07  <jeff> hah. service bulletin that might explain some of the random lockups we've had on this unit: 12V supply incorrectly wired to 5V input on one of the internal components. :-)
2015-03-10T16:31:23  <Dyrcona> Well, that'll do it.

2015-03-10T16:46:19  <Dyrcona> That horror comes back every time you look at one.
2015-03-10T16:47:20  <Dyrcona> Ever look at a raw binary MARC record?

2015-03-10T17:05:46  <eeevil> @later tell Dyrcona re method_lookup(), if it can't resolve the method name locally, it will go to the router, get a list of services, go to each and gather their methods, then try to resolve the method by name again.  it supports simple service discovery: "I don't care who implements this method, just do what I want" ... that functionality is not used inside evergreen (we only resolve local methods via method_lookup)
