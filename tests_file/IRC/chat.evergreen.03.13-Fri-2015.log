2015-03-13T09:53:09  <Bmagic> Does evergreen check to see if a copy will fill a hold when you check it in even if that copy was not the target of the hold? We have a situation where a hold was on a pull list for library A and by the time they came back to check it in, it was filled by library B. The hold targeter hadn't changed the target copy in that time
2015-03-13T09:53:47  *** ericar has quit IRC
2015-03-13T09:53:57  *** dbwells_ is now known as dbwells
2015-03-13T09:55:26  <bshum> Bmagic: Yeah, that's "opportunistic" hold capture at work.
2015-03-13T09:55:41  <Bmagic> bshum: ah! That explains it
2015-03-13T09:55:50  <bshum> Where lib B can fill a hold if the hold has been around too long (too long being if you use the settings)
2015-03-13T09:56:02  <bshum> We use the "soft stalling" option in the library settings to try to mitigate that.
2015-03-13T09:56:19  <bshum> Soft stalling will prevent opportunistic capture by other libraries before X time
2015-03-13T09:56:48  <bshum> So in our consortium, for example
2015-03-13T09:56:56  <bshum> We use an interval of "3 days" soft stalling
2015-03-13T09:57:03  <Bmagic> interesting
2015-03-13T09:57:07  <Bmagic> I need to bring this up
2015-03-13T09:57:11  <bshum> To give the pickup library up to 3 days to opportunistically capture the item
2015-03-13T09:57:22  <bshum> Before it's open season to any library that owns a copy and checks it in
2015-03-13T09:57:31  <bshum> This operates separately from the hold targeter.
2015-03-13T09:57:34  *** ericar_ has quit IRC
2015-03-13T09:57:36  <bshum> Which may select any library anyways
2015-03-13T09:57:53  <bshum> But only the pickup lib can initiate an opportunistic capture with any copy initially.
2015-03-13T09:58:48  <bshum> If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend this powerpoint slides from an earlier Evergreen conference where folks from ESI tried to "explain" how holds work:
2015-03-13T09:58:50  <bshum> http://evergreen-ils.org/~corinne/Hippos_Final.ppt
2015-03-13T09:59:00  <Bmagic> bshum++
2015-03-13T09:59:07  <bshum> It's a little older, but still helpful for the basic ideas.
2015-03-13T09:59:23  <bshum> Though things have evolved ever so much with all the newer features for hold targeting in 2.4+
2015-03-13T10:00:06  <bshum> But in any case, the behavior you described is... "normal"
2015-03-13T10:00:40  <bshum> That's basically the "whoever is fastest wins" default.
2015-03-13T10:00:55  <bshum> Tell Library A to stop slacking, obviously....
2015-03-13T10:00:56  <bshum> :D
2015-03-13T10:03:17  <Bmagic> lol
2015-03-13T10:03:36  <jboyer-isl> Bmagic: we have some experience messing with that. EI went from 2-3 days of soft stalling to 0, now weâ€™re back at 1 day for specifically the reason you mentioned about the hold pull list.
2015-03-13T10:05:58  <Bmagic> So, if the hold is targeted on library's A's copy. Library A has 2 copies but they can't find the exact barcode that it calls for, then the other copy should fill the hold just fine?
2015-03-13T10:06:16  <collum> \me has a desire to write up a LP enhancement for a popup that reads "Stop Slacking"
2015-03-13T10:06:18  <bshum> Uh, it depends.
2015-03-13T10:06:33  <bshum> So if the pickup library is library A, then yes, any copy at Library A will work.
2015-03-13T10:06:55  <bshum> But if the pickup library is Library B, and it's a "targeted" hold at a specific copy at Library A, then it will only work with that specific copy.
2015-03-13T10:07:05  <bshum> Until the hold stalling period ends, and then any copy from anywhere will work.
2015-03-13T10:07:44  <bshum> Basically it's the least number of transits required idea
2015-03-13T10:07:54  <bshum> If you're going to pick it up at that library, any copy there shall do.
2015-03-13T10:08:05  <bshum> If you've got to send it somewhere, only send what we're asking for, no more.
2015-03-13T10:08:29  <bshum> Unless the hold has been waiting around too long, then please send the next available copy, anybody!
2015-03-13T10:09:10  *** Newziky has joined #evergreen
2015-03-13T10:09:12  <Bmagic> 3 days seems weird
2015-03-13T10:09:26  <Bmagic> because the hold targeter will pick a different copy anyway every 24 hours
2015-03-13T10:09:29  <bshum> It was the happy medium that worked for our consortium.
2015-03-13T10:09:43  <bshum> Originally, we were 5 days actually.
2015-03-13T10:09:59  <bshum> Because our first two pilot libraries were estimated to be about 5 days apart.
2015-03-13T10:10:04  <Bmagic> Your hold targeter doesn't change the target every 24 hours?
2015-03-13T10:10:22  <bshum> In terms of trying to calculate based on how often the delivery truck went to the libs in question.
2015-03-13T10:10:55  <bshum> We still need to play more with proximity to try grouping libs into better combinations for delivery.
2015-03-13T10:11:00  <bshum> But meh
2015-03-13T10:11:07  <bshum> It depends on the item.
2015-03-13T10:11:14  <Bmagic> so, you changed your hold targeter as well?
2015-03-13T10:11:22  <bshum> Nope, that's just what it is.
2015-03-13T10:11:30  <bshum> It doesn't *always* pick a new copy from elsewhere.
2015-03-13T10:11:38  <bshum> And not all libs check their pull list consistently every day.
2015-03-13T10:11:46  <bshum> So some will do it twice a week
2015-03-13T10:11:52  <bshum> And others will do it four times a day.
2015-03-13T10:11:59  <Bmagic> so, you see why I'm confused about a soft stall for any interval greater than 24 hours?
2015-03-13T10:12:16  <bshum> It gives the pickup library a few days to get their act together.
2015-03-13T10:12:24  <bshum> The hold target may shift constantly
2015-03-13T10:12:39  <bshum> But opportunistic capture at the pickup lib can happen at any time within those initial 3 days.
2015-03-13T10:13:00  <bshum> So if a hold is captured by target elsewhere in the consortium, then yeah whatever, it locks on that, and that's the copy you get.
2015-03-13T10:13:10  <bshum> Unless you use more settings to trump that and use the local copy first.
2015-03-13T10:13:12  <Bmagic> So it shows up on thier pull list even though it's targeted a different copy in the meantime?
2015-03-13T10:13:20  <bshum> No, it's not about the pull list
2015-03-13T10:13:23  <bshum> It's about check-in
2015-03-13T10:13:34  <bshum> You asked about during checkin, do holds get checked and filled
2015-03-13T10:13:43  <bshum> And yes, they do, opportunistically at the pickup lib level
2015-03-13T10:14:05  <bshum> These are separate things;  opportunistic holds work at the same time as targeted holds
2015-03-13T10:14:11  <csharp> argh - we should really stop letting people clone and edit reports
2015-03-13T10:14:26  <Bmagic> csharp: I agree!

2015-03-13T10:15:21  <bshum> It's too microscopic to try defining the scenario, in reality, you've got dozens of copies and lots of holds at the same time.
2015-03-13T10:15:45  * csharp stops whining and gets back to it ;-)
2015-03-13T10:15:56  <jeff> csharp: what's that you say? you'd prefer that a smaller subset of people DESIGN the reports, and then there's an easier self-service means of running them?
2015-03-13T10:16:07  <csharp> jeff: haha
2015-03-13T10:16:15  * csharp knows what's coming
2015-03-13T10:16:29  <jeff> csharp: seems like there's a library doing something along thoes lines somewhere...
2015-03-13T10:16:32  * jeff grins
2015-03-13T10:16:39  <csharp> exactly
2015-03-13T10:17:00  <collum> jeff beat me too it ;-)
2015-03-13T10:17:00  <bshum> Bmagic: So the soft stall of 3 days is mainly to give the pickup library a good interval to get the book back and check it in, to capture the next hold and get it to fill for that.  Instead of having any checkin at any library that has that copy to capture, transit, and fill the hold.
2015-03-13T10:17:57  <bshum> Bmagic: This is separate from the hold targeting process itself, which does try for a new target every 24 hours (based on when the hold was placed and how often you run hold_targeter) and that's what drives the pull lists and tells people what they should pull from the shelves to check in and see if it's still needed.
2015-03-13T10:18:00  <Bmagic> bshum: Back to my original scenario where library B filled A's hold opportunistically. With the soft stall in place for library A, this would not be possible? I'm confused because the hold targeter will target a different copy, and the other library might be commaned to pull it and fill it, during the stall interval for A
2015-03-13T10:18:05  *** afterl has joined #evergreen
2015-03-13T10:18:30  <bshum> Bmagic: That is correct.  It's whoever is faster in that scenario you describe then.
2015-03-13T10:18:51  <csharp> the soft stall was originally invented to deal with PINES courier delays, which were serious at the time, but those delays went away (probably before the feature was fully implemented)
2015-03-13T10:18:55  <bshum> *still whoever was faster
2015-03-13T10:19:32  <csharp> so people in our consortium who don't remember those days wonder why there's a 5 day stall
2015-03-13T10:19:58  <bshum> Even if we don't have courier delays, irregular hold pull list checking, etc., the perception of delays still makes people feel better knowing that they've got the chance to use their copy to fill the hold ahead of transit copies, if they're efficient about it.
2015-03-13T10:20:30  <bshum> So I go back to my earlier statement:  "Tell Library A to stop slacking, obviously...."
2015-03-13T10:21:14  <Bmagic> Im still fuzzy on this. Let me ask another question that might help. If the hold is inside of the soft stall interval, nobody can fill the hold opportunistically except the library who has the soft stall?
2015-03-13T10:22:06  <bshum> Bmagic: To be honest, I've never used soft stalling settings except consortially.  So I do not know what happens if you only apply it to a specific library.
2015-03-13T10:22:27  <Bmagic> OK, consortially then
2015-03-13T10:22:50  <bshum> If it's consortial, then only the pickup library can capture opportunistically.
2015-03-13T10:22:59  <bshum> Everyone else checks in normally
2015-03-13T10:23:06  <bshum> And only uses their copy for targeted holds
2015-03-13T10:23:17  <bshum> Or holds that are past the soft stalling and can be captured opportunistically.
2015-03-13T10:23:48  <Bmagic> I got it

2015-03-13T12:05:09  <Dyrcona> Let me check my restore script, I think we fix it in a script we run after.
2015-03-13T12:07:14  <Dyrcona> Yep: ALTER DATABASE :db_name SET search_path=evergreen, public, pg_catalog;
2015-03-13T12:08:06  <Dyrcona> with -v db_name=actual_database_name on the command line
2015-03-13T12:09:08  <Dyrcona> And, I don't think it is necessary (or didn't used to be) if your database user's name is evergreen.
2015-03-13T12:09:57  <Dyrcona> IIRC, postgres looks in a schema named for the current user, then in public, then in pg_catalog by default, but as always, I could be wrong or misremembering.
2015-03-13T12:14:26  <jeff> pg_restore still breaks some things.
2015-03-13T12:14:36  <jeff> because it will explicitly set the search path.
2015-03-13T12:15:22  <jeff> so unless you're also hand-editing the pg_restore commands, you're going to be doing things like (at least) re-creating a few indexes that fail due to search path.
2015-03-13T12:15:39  <jeff> though it's possible that THAT was fixed and I just missed that it's been fixed in more-recent versions.
2015-03-13T12:15:50  <jeff> I'll try and bother to look.
2015-03-13T12:16:20  <Dyrcona> We haven't had trouble with indexes in quite a while.
2015-03-13T12:16:54  <Dyrcona> We do have trouble with config.z3950_index_field_map from time to time.
2015-03-13T12:17:36  <Dyrcona> So, we check if select * returns anything and if not, we insert the values that should be in the table in our script we run post-restore.
2015-03-13T12:18:01  <Dyrcona> Just below setting the path, actually.
2015-03-13T12:18:26  <Dyrcona> I believe the index problems were fixed at some point.
2015-03-13T12:20:03  <bshum> ~search_path
2015-03-13T12:20:03  <pinesol_green> After restoring a database, make sure to reset the search_path accordingly with something like: alter database unpredicable_haxxors_go_away set search_path = evergreen, public, pg_catalog;

2015-03-13T16:08:19  <pinesol_green> kmlussier, Dyrcona and jboyer-isl hate Launchpad search
2015-03-13T16:08:38  <bshum> Launchpad search sucks.
2015-03-13T16:09:03  <bshum> My head is filled with the names and descriptions of so many bugs now... past, present
2015-03-13T16:09:10  <Dyrcona> I seriously think it only searches bug titles, even in advanced search.
2015-03-13T16:09:14  <jboyer-isl> my terms are unique, ugly, weird, and should only retrieve the one ticket Iâ€™m looking for, but no.
2015-03-13T16:09:14  <bshum> They haunt my dreams
2015-03-13T16:09:25  <kmlussier> Does it really, though? I sometimes find the problem has nothing to do with Launchpad, but everything to do with the fact that I describe problems in an entirely different way than somebody else.
2015-03-13T16:09:54  <maryj> Can the launchpad search be enhanced at all?
2015-03-13T16:10:10  <maryj> (or is that my hopeful optimism showing?)
2015-03-13T16:10:14  <bshum> kmlussier: Typos too.
2015-03-13T16:10:16  <bshum> :)
2015-03-13T16:10:24  <Dyrcona> "Why can't search work like [insert multi-billion dollar online corporation here]?"
2015-03-13T16:10:48  <bshum> maryj: To be honest, I usually just use google search and append whatever I'm looking for with "Evergreen launchpad"
2015-03-13T16:11:00  <bshum> And 90% of the time, that gets me a link to the real LP bug entry that I was hoping for ;)
2015-03-13T16:11:06  <Dyrcona> I just got to create a new bug. That usually finds the one I'm looking for.
2015-03-13T16:11:22  <bshum> Or I just search my email to find the reference too.
2015-03-13T16:11:27  <bshum> Which is also gmail, so, heh
2015-03-13T16:11:29  <kmlussier> I think it would help if the default search included more types of bugs. I know duplicates are automatically excluded as well as ones marked as opinion or invalid.
2015-03-13T16:12:04  <Dyrcona> yeah, I sometimes search my bug email folder.
2015-03-13T16:13:46  <jboyer-isl> git tells me the thing Iâ€™m searching for has not been changed. Does anyone know whatever happened to any discussion of the money.m_b_x_open_xacts_idx index? Itâ€™s only an index on money.billable_xact (usr) and doesnâ€™t have anything to do with xact_finish being null (as the name implies)
2015-03-13T16:14:50  <jeff> jboyer-isl: do you recall discussion?
2015-03-13T16:15:18  <jboyer-isl> I could have sworn I saw someone ask about it at some point, but Google tells me Iâ€™m making it up. :-/
2015-03-13T16:17:12  <Dyrcona> My email search tells me you're making it up, too. :)
2015-03-13T16:17:30  <Dyrcona> 'Course, I'll have saved bug mails back to November 9, 2012.
2015-03-13T16:17:37  <Dyrcona> I only have...
2015-03-13T16:17:54  <jboyer-isl> Anyway, I find myself needing such an index and didnâ€™t know if I had missed a fix for it. Apparently not.
2015-03-13T16:17:56  <Dyrcona> I could check the dev list.
2015-03-13T16:19:16  <Dyrcona> Nothing on the dev list back to 2008 either.
2015-03-13T16:20:47  <Dyrcona> I hate to start a flame war, but I don't think we should be mucking with the schema on point (i.e. bug fix) releases.
2015-03-13T16:23:10  <jboyer-isl> Oh well. Thanks for the sanity check everyone. Iâ€™ll look into my project a little more and then probably hit launchpad so no one can find my bug later. ;)
2015-03-13T16:23:21  <jboyer-isl> Dyrcona: agreed (re: schema)
2015-03-13T16:24:30  <jonadab> As a general principle, I (in complete and total ignorance of the specific thing being referred to) would tend to agree with that.
2015-03-13T16:24:52  <Dyrcona> The schema is the database layout, including tables and columns.
2015-03-13T16:25:00  <jonadab> Right, I know what a schema is.
2015-03-13T16:25:12  <jonadab> I meant I don't know of the specific schema mucking that is being discussed.
2015-03-13T16:25:15  <Dyrcona> I think if a bug fix requires a change to the schema, then it should not go into a point release.
2015-03-13T16:25:28  <Dyrcona> I'm speaking in general terms, not to anything specific.
2015-03-13T16:25:33  <jonadab> Oh, I see.
2015-03-13T16:25:37  <jonadab> In that case I would tend to agree.
2015-03-13T16:25:53  <Dyrcona> A discussion of running database upgrade scripts came up on the general mailing list.
2015-03-13T16:26:02  * csharp hates when he drops closing quotes and parens 
2015-03-13T16:26:05  <jonadab> Unless the bug is extremely important (think: data loss crash) and the schema change can be done in a backward-compatible way.
2015-03-13T16:26:43  * Dyrcona hates when he makes any kind of typo.
2015-03-13T16:27:00  * Dyrcona usually lets it go when others do.

2015-03-13T16:31:35  <csharp> but since so much app logic has moved to the DB, I can see that it's probably necessary to add DB stuff to even point releases

2015-03-13T16:33:03  <csharp> true
2015-03-13T16:33:14  <gmcharlt> the latter being (oftne, but not always) easier to backport

2015-03-13T16:41:49  *** chatley_ has quit IRC
2015-03-13T16:41:50  <gmcharlt> there are exceptions, of course, but there's rather less DB schema churn during maintenance release cycles as a consequence of that policy

2015-03-13T16:42:22  *** chatley has joined #evergreen
2015-03-13T16:42:29  <Dyrcona> We are supposed to have a similar policy, but I think we elide the definition of bug fix a bit.

2015-03-13T16:42:49  *** dreuther has joined #evergreen

2015-03-13T16:44:02  <Dyrcona> It's kind of funny that bshum and I would be pushing this, since we both run master and therefore shouldn't care. :)
2015-03-13T16:44:15  <gmcharlt> looking at the changes in the Koha 3.18.x maint cycle so far, the only actual schema changes as such are one change of a column type and adding an index
2015-03-13T16:44:38  <Dyrcona> I'd have no problem with adding an index.
2015-03-13T16:46:08  <gmcharlt> yeah
2015-03-13T16:46:18  <Dyrcona> The question of how to run the upgrade scripts or problems with them come up often enough, though.
