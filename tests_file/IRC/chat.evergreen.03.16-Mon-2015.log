2015-03-16T09:09:07  <tsbere> Coming back from a vacation today means I am not getting anything done. Too many things to catch up on. <_<
2015-03-16T09:11:04  <Dyrcona> hmm. takes a while to index 17.9 million rows.
2015-03-16T09:11:33  <Dyrcona> Good thing I didn't load all 347 million.

2015-03-16T10:11:40  <MrMayor> Hey guys (and gals). Does anyone know if it is possible to add a custom circ duration rule to an entire permission group instead of items?
2015-03-16T10:13:55  <bshum> MrMayor: I think gsams left you a later message over the weekend explaining it is possible.
2015-03-16T10:14:21  <bshum> http://irc.evergreen-ils.org/evergreen/2015-03-14#i_164181
2015-03-16T10:14:39  <bshum> That's a link back to his comment from the logs
2015-03-16T10:15:41  <tsbere> MrMayor: For the really short answer: Yes, if your system is configured properly for it. ;)
2015-03-16T10:20:06  <MrMayor> I see haha. But I believe everything we have has item info so I don't know how much of a solution it might be. Nothing to do but give it a shot though.

2015-03-16T10:20:48  <tsbere> MrMayor: If your weights are set to make permission group the most important field then it will trump anything else.
2015-03-16T10:21:52  <MrMayor> Woulnd't those weights affect everything?
2015-03-16T10:22:57  <tsbere> Depends. Permission group is, if I recall, near the top already on default weights.
2015-03-16T10:24:50  <Dyrcona> I think it is second-most important after the location.
2015-03-16T10:25:06  <Dyrcona> But, my memory has been faulty lately.
2015-03-16T10:27:20  <MrMayor> Thanks for all your help guys. I was on the right track, just wasn't changing the permission group properly. I got it working correctly

2015-03-16T11:13:04  <jeff> well, this just starts to taste like xulrunner and remote xul: https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=378566 "Block sub-resource loads from the web to private networks and localhost"
2015-03-16T11:17:45  <Dyrcona> I *love* comment #40. That' really a common use case? A remote web site wanting to refer to local daemons?
2015-03-16T11:19:54  <jeff> Seems like Opera already does similar to this with an interstitial to bypass the block (that you might have to trigger in wacky ways since it doesn't come up for background requests by default)
2015-03-16T11:20:25  <Dyrcona> Yeah.
2015-03-16T11:20:50  <Dyrcona> This sounds like it might bugger the web staff client, no?
2015-03-16T11:23:16  <jeff> It has the potential to complicate web staff client communication with a locally-running hatch instance. Currently the web client makes a wss://localhost:8443/hatch connection to talk to hatch.
2015-03-16T11:25:21  <jeff> from the submitter elsewhere: ``We also appreciate the concerns for legacy apps, local servers, etc. That's why we plan on supporting blocking UI overrides, opt-in by the page on localhost/private (maybe via CORS headers), and permanent exceptions via the command-line and enterprise policy.''
2015-03-16T11:26:20  <jeff> more freeform discussion here, in addition to the comments in the bug: https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=9210484
2015-03-16T11:27:14  <jeff> The nice thing is that in contrast with "kill remote XUL", we seem to have much more company in the camp of "please don't do this without a good path that supports our use case". :-)
2015-03-16T11:27:43  <jeff> statements like "Dropbox does this, Github for Mac does this (and incidentally, my own home-grown solution for reading barcode scanners does this too)."
2015-03-16T11:39:52  <Dyrcona> Stuff like that makes me think they choose the wrong platform.

2015-03-16T11:46:52  <jeff> ah, right. dokuwiki sets list-id header, so it gets auto-filtered.
2015-03-16T11:54:14  <Dyrcona> kmlussier: My development VM is back up and running with fresh data and fresh code.

2015-03-16T11:57:14  <jeff> thought that didn't look familiar.

2015-03-16T12:01:07  <Dyrcona> Thanks for the reminder. I forgot to add it to my calendar.
2015-03-16T12:02:02  <Dyrcona> So, where's Chromium going once cod.google.com is shut down?
2015-03-16T12:02:09  <Dyrcona> code, even. :)
2015-03-16T12:02:27  <kmlussier> Dyrcona: Thank you very much!
2015-03-16T12:02:42  <Dyrcona> I apparently own two projects on code.google.com and completely forgot about them.
2015-03-16T12:03:01  <Dyrcona> kmlussier: You're welcome very much!
2015-03-16T12:10:46  <jeff> I also updated the http://wiki.evergreen-ils.org/doku.php?id=dev:meetings page so that "Next meeting" correctly shows today's upcoming meeting, moved Feb to Past, etc.
2015-03-16T12:13:00  <Dyrcona> jeff: Will you facilitate the meeting, too? ;)

2015-03-16T12:45:39  <jeff> ``Google will continue to provide Git and Gerrit hosting for certain projects like Android and Chrome. We will also continue maintaining our mirrors of projects like Eclipse, kernel.org and others.''
2015-03-16T12:47:03  <jeff> heh. if you have any issues exporting your project from google code, you are asked to open an issue at code.google.com...
2015-03-16T12:50:21  <Dyrcona> Well, seeing as I had forgotten about the two projects I have up there, I think I'll just let 'em die.

2015-03-16T13:57:46  <Dyrcona> You'll need to do a metabib.reingest_record_attributes on each record to get the pictures to show up properly.
2015-03-16T13:57:57  <Dyrcona> You might as well do a complete reingest.

2015-03-16T15:11:27  <gmcharlt> what *would* warrant a 2.5 is http2 support, IMO

2015-03-16T15:12:07  <gmcharlt> ?
2015-03-16T15:13:05  <Dyrcona> Doesn't look it warrants a 2.5 just for the diagnostic changes.

2015-03-16T15:29:05  <dbwells> I agree
2015-03-16T15:29:42  <gmcharlt> ok

2015-03-16T15:29:56  <gmcharlt> #info OPW project finsihed on 3/9
2015-03-16T15:30:08  <gmcharlt> #info Project blog is at http://lima-julia.tumblr.com/
2015-03-16T15:30:19  <gmcharlt> #info Project branch is at https://github.com/JuliaLima/Evergreen/tree/patch-1/docs/style_guide
2015-03-16T15:30:27  <gmcharlt> julialima: you have the floor
2015-03-16T15:31:00  <dbwells> julialima has agreed to join us today for at least one more time (hopefully more again, someday :)
2015-03-16T15:32:02  <dbwells> I took the opportunity to post some public gists to the agenda to perhaps encourage more review of what has been accomplished so far.
2015-03-16T15:32:27  <dbwells> The guide is much more interesting and entertaining with all the pictures in place.
2015-03-16T15:33:18  <dbwells> Finally, the "Next Steps" is my interpretation of some of julialima's recommendations in her last blog post.
2015-03-16T15:33:43  <dbwells> Basically, how do we get this to a point where it is in full use?
2015-03-16T15:33:57  <gmcharlt> julialima: I'd be interested in hearing your thoughts
2015-03-16T15:35:58  <julialima> Well, I know it is not easy the implementation of the UI style guide, so I try to think in the starting points about how to implement it (that is what I wrote in my blog post)
2015-03-16T15:36:59  <julialima> And I think dbwells understand what I mean in his proposal. I really hope it can be achieve
2015-03-16T15:37:07  <gmcharlt> julialima: thanks, that helps :)
2015-03-16T15:39:11  <gmcharlt> so, I think there are some details to digest
2015-03-16T15:39:17  <gmcharlt> do folks have any immediate feedback?
2015-03-16T15:39:20  <kmlussier> I would like to see the full style guide posted somewhere on the Evergreen web site. Maybe as an appendix to the docs?
2015-03-16T15:39:28  <Bmagic> julialima++
2015-03-16T15:39:57  <hopkinsju> julialima++
2015-03-16T15:41:22  <gmcharlt> julialima++
2015-03-16T15:41:45  <dbwells> It seems like engagement here is pretty light today, so it probably makes sense to extend the "next steps" proposal discussion to the list as well?  I want to be clear that this proposal as written is my own, just so there is no confusion about it.
2015-03-16T15:42:11  <gmcharlt> yeah, I think moving the discussion onto open-ils-dev is the next step
2015-03-16T15:42:34  <gmcharlt> any other comments before we move on to the next agenda item?
2015-03-16T15:42:46  <dbwells> will do.  Does anyone have any immediate feedback on the idea of a new team?
2015-03-16T15:43:21  <dbwells> I'd like to address any concerns if possible when I email the list.
2015-03-16T15:43:28  <remingtron> I like the idea of a new team to help facilitate adoption of the guide
2015-03-16T15:43:44  * kmlussier agrees
2015-03-16T15:43:45  <gmcharlt> -1 unless a reason can be articulated why a discussion cannot be held on open-ils-general and open-ils-dev
2015-03-16T15:44:46  <kmlussier> I don't see why discussion can't happen in our normal communication channels.
2015-03-16T15:45:39  <dbwells> I am thinking meetings would happen in #evergreen, certainly.  It is really more about commitment than anything else.
2015-03-16T15:45:40  <dbs> Let's start with the regular mailing lists and see what develops
2015-03-16T15:46:38  <kmlussier> I'm mostly interested in the commitment factor too. I actually wouldn't want to see too much more expansion happen with the style guide at this point. I would rather focus on starting to incorporate what's already there.
2015-03-16T15:47:14  <dbs> A big part of this is just building out the basic pieces that have been laid out
2015-03-16T15:47:43  <dbs> and we'll rename the .txt files to .adoc to get fancy highlighting in github :)
2015-03-16T15:47:54  <dbwells> +1 to that :)
2015-03-16T15:50:41  <gmcharlt> ok
2015-03-16T15:50:43  <julialima> Once more, I want to thank you all. It was an awesome experience for me. I am willing to help in whatever (opinions in general or questions about my work). I will try to be aware of the project and say hi once in a while. It was a real pleasure :)
2015-03-16T15:50:52  <gmcharlt> thanks, julialima!

2015-03-16T15:52:38  <gmcharlt> #info Link to discussion of Chromium potentially blocking localhost websockets access https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=378566
2015-03-16T15:54:08  <jeff> I added this -- there's not much in stone yet, but I wanted to ensure that as wide an audience was aware of the issue (and how it could potentially affect Evergreen).
2015-03-16T15:55:50  <gmcharlt> jeff++ # thanks for the heads-up
2015-03-16T15:56:07  <kmlussier> Monday must be a bad day for meetings.
2015-03-16T15:56:09  <jeff> We do not seem to be alone in having a use case for localhost WebSockets connections from Chrome, which is good.
2015-03-16T15:56:25  <gmcharlt> yeah, but we should add our voice to the chorus
2015-03-16T15:56:34  <gmcharlt> berick: are you up for that/
2015-03-16T15:56:35  <gmcharlt> ?
2015-03-16T15:56:53  <jeff> kmlussier: I'm just glad I didn't #startmeeting -- i'm presently out on the floor tag-teaming a recalcitrant microfilm scanner. :-)
2015-03-16T15:57:16  <kmlussier> heh
2015-03-16T15:57:27  * dbs needs to split for kids
2015-03-16T15:57:56  * Bmagic is glad dbs is not splitting kids
2015-03-16T15:58:22  <gmcharlt> ok, I"m going to assign an action anyway
2015-03-16T15:58:38  <gmcharlt> #action berick, gmcharlt, and eeevil will add a response to the chromium localhost ws bug
2015-03-16T15:58:56  <gmcharlt> and finally, very briefly

2015-03-16T15:59:18  <gmcharlt> does anybody have new stuff in the works they want to mention?
2015-03-16T16:00:23  <jeff> equally briefly: we're looking at adding some things to Missing Pieces with regard to default circ duration after marking missing, etc. If others are interested, let me know or look for a launchpad wishlist bug in the near future.
2015-03-16T16:00:53  <gmcharlt> sounds intriguing
2015-03-16T16:00:57  <gmcharlt> thanks, jeff!
2015-03-16T16:01:14  <gmcharlt> and as it is 16:01 here...

2015-03-16T16:01:43  <jboyer-isl> appologies for the partial attention, I was trying to get up to speed on the websockets issue.
2015-03-16T16:01:44  <eeevil> I'll mention here that there is a broad status update coming RSN for the sprint 1 web staff client bug hunting.  tl;dr: of 137 bugs opened, 7 remain unresolved (or undeferred)
2015-03-16T16:01:57  <eeevil> ha! I missed the end of the meeting with that. oops
2015-03-16T16:02:31  <jboyer-isl> I must not have been successful, because from what I'm reading it sounds like it's already too late for Firefox?

2015-03-16T16:50:06  <kmlussier> If a 14-year-old were getting started in programming, what language would be a good one to start them off in?
2015-03-16T16:50:47  <Dyrcona> Python or HTML/Javascript, but only the good parts of JavaScript.
2015-03-16T16:51:24  <Dyrcona> You can get instant gratification in both languages and getting to the fun stuff is not very hard.
2015-03-16T16:51:26  *** sandbergja has quit IRC
2015-03-16T16:51:51  <kmlussier> Ha ha. I just turned to my Twitter feed, and floating to the top was a tweet that said "Which programming language is best for beginners? "
2015-03-16T16:52:53  <kmlussier> My son was just looking through the local hs course catalog, and he said "the one elective I know I want to take is programming." Warmed my heart.
2015-03-16T16:53:37  <kmlussier> But then I looked at the description for their intro to programming...Visual Basic
2015-03-16T16:54:55  <Dyrcona> Well, it makes sense given how Microsoft has turned "computer science" in public High Schools into a "learn MS products" curriculum.
2015-03-16T16:55:31  <kmlussier> Sigh
2015-03-16T16:55:47  <eeevil> kmlussier: perl! (not kidding)
2015-03-16T16:55:49  <phasefx> kmlussier: PyLogo might be fun
2015-03-16T16:56:06  <Dyrcona> eeevil: You just earned your nick. ;)
2015-03-16T16:56:38  <Dyrcona> ...but only the good parts of Perl! ;)
2015-03-16T16:57:11  <kmlussier> eeevil: I was thinking perl might be something to pursue later. After getting started in something like python. No?
2015-03-16T16:57:27  <Dyrcona> kmlussier: I made that remark about JavaScript earlier, because there is a book entitled JavaScript: The Good Parts.
2015-03-16T16:57:34  <_bott_> Perl's regex handling has ruined me for all others
2015-03-16T16:57:54  <Dyrcona> _bott_: libpcre, you can take it with you. :)
2015-03-16T16:58:07  <Dyrcona> Well, most of it, anyway.
2015-03-16T16:58:07  <jonadab> Eww, visualbasic--
2015-03-16T16:58:09  <eeevil> kmlussier: python's no easier or harder than any other language ... in reality, learning /any/ language but PHP will teach you a LOT
2015-03-16T16:58:12  <eeevil> IMNSHO
2015-03-16T16:58:30  <Dyrcona> PHP will teach a lot. Mostly how *not* to do things.
2015-03-16T16:58:34  <jonadab> Any of the major VHLLs would be fine -- Perl, Python, Ruby.
2015-03-16T16:58:37  <eeevil> Dyrcona: point
2015-03-16T16:58:53  <jonadab> And yes, avoid PHP.
2015-03-16T16:58:58  <Dyrcona> Actually, I've seen good PHP code.
2015-03-16T16:59:03  <eeevil> and also IMNSHO, the camel book is one of the best "learn to think like a programmer" books ever
2015-03-16T16:59:04  <tsbere> I think PHP teaches you how to do things better than VB. <_<
2015-03-16T16:59:11  <jonadab> PHP is actually much, MUCH better than it used to be.
2015-03-16T16:59:15  <jonadab> But that's relative.
2015-03-16T16:59:41  <Dyrcona> Well, I picked up VB late. I started back when computers booted to a BASIC prompt.
2015-03-16T16:59:48  <jonadab> Inform6 is also a decent choice, albeit with a very limited application domain.
2015-03-16T17:00:10  <eeevil> (and by that I mean it teaches you what happens as you interact with the computer through the language, not just "here's the syntax")
2015-03-16T17:00:21  <_bott_> I don't trust languages I can't write with vi
2015-03-16T17:00:36  <Dyrcona> Nothing like programming in C on Mac System 7 for learning discipline.
2015-03-16T17:00:50  <Dyrcona> But, anyway, time to go.
2015-03-16T17:01:04  <kmlussier> Dyrcona: I started on BASIC too
2015-03-16T17:01:09  <phasefx> jonadab: xyzzy!
2015-03-16T17:01:17  <jonadab> Dyrcona: I've been learning C by studing the NetHack codebase.  Really.
2015-03-16T17:01:30  <jonadab> And yes, that's every bit as crazy as it sounds.
2015-03-16T17:01:32  <kmlussier> The plan was to move on to Cobol and Pascal, but then my high school replaced all of the TRS-80's with these new things called Macs.
2015-03-16T17:01:37  <kmlussier> I haven't used a Mac since.
2015-03-16T17:01:45  <kmlussier> Well, not willingly. :)
2015-03-16T17:01:47  <jonadab> phasefx: Yes.

2015-03-16T17:03:24  <Bmagic> kmlussier: HTML, QBASIC, Java, C#, PERL in that order
2015-03-16T17:03:24  <phasefx> jonadab: cool deal. I just looked at the date on this thing.  Oy :)
2015-03-16T17:03:31  <jonadab> Heh.
2015-03-16T17:04:36  <phasefx> kmlussier: you missed a good humble bundle recently that had programming books for young people
2015-03-16T17:05:51  <kmlussier> phasefx: Really? Do they do those often?
