2015-03-31T10:54:50  <bshum> Will that work, or will the upgrade script in the rc1 tarball have the wrong stamp?
2015-03-31T10:55:02  <bshum> Or did you make it as straight 2.8.0
2015-03-31T10:55:09  <berick> i built rc1 with version =  2.8.0
2015-03-31T10:55:24  <berick> for just this reason
2015-03-31T10:55:25  <bshum> Ahh, slick ;)

2015-03-31T11:03:55  <kmlussier> What does this mean for 2.5 and 2.6? Does 2.5 get pushed off the downloads page? Is 2.6 security only now?
2015-03-31T11:05:00  <kmlussier> We provide support for one month after two stable releases have been made available. So that means 2.6 is still supported.
2015-03-31T11:05:41  <bshum> 2.5 is off.
2015-03-31T11:05:50  <kmlussier> No, wait, I'm reading something old.
2015-03-31T11:05:52  <bshum> 2.6 is now "security release only" I think.
2015-03-31T11:08:22  <kmlussier> Well, technically I think it's still supported. It gets 12 months, right? Looks like it was released at the end of April last year.
2015-03-31T11:08:44  <bshum> Yeah, but more or less it's over :)
2015-03-31T11:08:59  <bshum> You'd have to look at the exact release date if you want to get all technical about it ;)

2015-03-31T11:10:10  <kmlussier> April 21
2015-03-31T11:11:58  <jonadab> IMO, supporting existing installs of an old version is one thing, and continuing to have it featured on the download page is different, because that encourages new installs of that version.

2015-03-31T11:40:14  <berick> will do
2015-03-31T11:40:41  <kmlussier> I left 2.6 as stable since it was released on April 21. But if y'all think it should be put into security only, I can make that change.

2015-03-31T13:59:23  <dbs> Hmm. so acq.invoice_payment_method is empty by default, that seems a bit surprising
2015-03-31T14:10:19  <kmlussier> dbs: It would be nice to set a default when configuring the payment methods. Or maybe make that field sticky.
2015-03-31T14:10:46  <kmlussier> I don't know if our libs make heavy use of that field since they tend to use the same payment method for everything.
2015-03-31T14:25:58  <dbs> huh, 'obj = {"acqlia":[{"1":"uncommon","__fuzzy":true}ÿÿÿÿð' seems bad (JavaScript console error trying to view the history of an invoice

2015-03-31T14:53:49  <dbs> huzzah for task-oriented docs!
2015-03-31T14:56:33  <dbs> Looks like our special snowflake acq process is going to be to create tons of individual POs, then create an invoice when we receive a shipment by adding those POs progressively to the invoice, then receiving the entire invoice in bulk
2015-03-31T14:57:37  <dbs> which turns everything from "encumbered" to "paid", but isn't really paid until a month or so later when the uni finance dept actually cuts a cheque, at which point we add charges/credits for currency adjustments to the invoice before closing it
2015-03-31T14:58:20  <dbs> kind of wish the "encumbered" would stay "encumbered" when the items are received but the invoice hasn't been closed, but oh well; should work

2015-03-31T15:02:05  <kmlussier> dbs: That's been on our wishlist for a while.
2015-03-31T15:04:21  <kmlussier> In fact, one of our partners is looking for quotes to do something similar if anyone is interested in doing some acq work. http://wiki.evergreen-ils.org/doku.php?id=evergreen_features:proposed_development_projects#approval_process_for_edi_invoices
2015-03-31T15:04:31  <kmlussier> Except, in this case, it would just be for EDI invoices.
2015-03-31T15:06:02  <kmlussier> dbs: When you say individual POs, do you mean creating a PO for each lineitem?
2015-03-31T15:07:53  <dbs> kmlussier: I guess just individual lineitems that just float around until we receive a shipment + invoice
2015-03-31T15:08:15  <dbs> For Amazon orders, though, individual prepaid POs

2015-03-31T15:11:54  * pinesol_green sitka is the very model of a modern major hacker for awesome acq docs
2015-03-31T15:12:50  <kmlussier> dbs: It doesn't sound too special snowflake to me. Our libraries put a bunch of lineitems on a PO to place the order and then gather the lineitems from one shipment into an invoice as you described.
2015-03-31T15:13:35  <kmlussier> When it's not an EDI invoice, that is.
2015-03-31T15:13:55  <dbs> actually no, we do need to create tons of individual POs
2015-03-31T15:14:38  <dbs> I guess they could add individual line items to a single PO but there doesn't seem to be much advantage to that
2015-03-31T15:16:44  <kmlussier> dbs: If you were using EDI, it would be advantageous. But even when ordering manually, I think our libraries like to see all of the titles ordered at one time in one place.
2015-03-31T15:21:19  <kmlussier> I'm looking at the "Obscure the Date of birth field" OU setting.
2015-03-31T15:21:29  <kmlussier> The description says: "When true, the Date of Birth column in patron lists will default to Not Visible, and in the Patron Summary sidebar the value will display as unless the field label is clicked."
2015-03-31T15:21:50  <kmlussier> Which patron lists is it referring to? I looked in the list of patron search results, but the DOB is visible.

2015-03-31T15:28:49  <tsbere> I just know a lot of settings like that are, in effect, cached once at login and never checked again during your session.
2015-03-31T15:29:18  <phasefx> kmlussier: looks like it should only touch patron search, patron summary, and the patron Groups interface
2015-03-31T15:29:57  <phasefx> I also don't see anything that suggests it actually works anymore, at least in patron search
2015-03-31T15:29:59  <kmlussier> It works in patron summary. As far as I can tell, it doesn't work in patron search, but I'm also not on a clean, master system.
2015-03-31T15:30:26  <kmlussier> OK, it's not just me. I'm actually filing the bug for the webclient, but I always like to check to see how it worked in xul first.

2015-03-31T15:35:03  <phasefx> kmlussier: it's only the default columns, so once you save your columns once, defaults don't come into play

2015-03-31T15:36:20  <kmlussier> I'll just add it to the bug for the webclient. Not sure how much time I want to spend nailing down a xulrunner issue. :)
2015-03-31T15:36:48  <phasefx> it's a very minor bug/feature given the configurability of columns
2015-03-31T15:37:10  <kmlussier> Yeah, I think most people have customized those.

2015-03-31T15:49:19  <kmlussier> phasefx: I do think there may be opportunities to remove some GUI settings with the web client since it is easier to customize the web client.

2015-03-31T15:51:37  <dbs> we just removed the pertinent fields from the XUL completely
