2015-04-02T09:04:42  <kmlussier> I picture a darkened room, a person with his/her head lying on the bar, begging for just one more cup of Earl Grey.
2015-04-02T09:05:27  <jeff> huh. i guessed that tea would be one from Upton Tea Imports (aside from the url having "upton" in it, which was a pretty big clue).

2015-04-02T12:35:42  <csharp> having just spent the better part of two hours trying to get dpkg-buildpackage to not treat format-security warnings as fatal errors, that question is on my mind ;-)

2015-04-02T12:36:22  <csharp> example (that I'm pasting in channel, yes)
2015-04-02T12:36:25  <csharp> utils.c:133:2: error: format not a string literal and no format arguments [-Werror=format-security] return snprintf( *(global_argv), global_argv_size, VA_BUF ); ^
2015-04-02T12:36:37  <csharp> ah - that came out as one line here ;-)
2015-04-02T12:37:30  <csharp> that particular warning is from building OpenSRF on Ubuntu 14.04
2015-04-02T12:37:45  <csharp> gcc 4.8.2
2015-04-02T12:39:02  <csharp> for the logs/the curious, I was able to circumvent the fatality of those errors by adding 'export DEB_CFLAGS_MAINT_APPEND= -Wno-error=format-security' to my debian rules file
2015-04-02T12:39:41  <csharp> but the real solution would be to fix the causes of the warnings

2015-04-02T12:48:33  <bshum> csharp: In general, I think if you've got some suggestions on how to address some of those warnings/errors you're seeing, it doesn't hurt to add them as LP tickets and target them towards the next OpenSRF milestones for review.
2015-04-02T12:48:49  <bshum> Or at the very least, noting them for further scrutiny by smarter folks than I :)
2015-04-02T12:53:08  <kmlussier> berick/dbwells: While I'm in the Release Notes, do we need to say anything there about the changes to the fine generator?

2015-04-02T13:40:51  <eeevil> csharp: re your compiler warning, that's how we rewrite the process title for top/ps ... we could look for other ways to do it, maybe, but it's "considered safe" in the context we use it (we control the strings -- it would take a malicious installation to exploit)
2015-04-02T13:41:02  <eeevil> in which case, you have bigger issues ;)

2015-04-02T14:03:47  <yboston> welcome everyone
2015-04-02T14:04:01  <yboston> Robert or Kathy, do either of you have anything to report?
2015-04-02T14:04:08  <yboston> it is OK if you don't

2015-04-02T14:04:25  <yboston> *ahead
2015-04-02T14:04:26  <kmlussier> #topic Release Coordinator Report
2015-04-02T14:04:50  <kmlussier> #info I am adding acknowledgements plus one missing feature to the Release Notes as we meet
2015-04-02T14:05:02  <kmlussier> #info The 2.8 Release Notes should be complete by the end of today.
2015-04-02T14:05:05  <kmlussier> End of report
2015-04-02T14:05:29  <kmlussier> Oh, I do have something else.
2015-04-02T14:05:48  <yboston> BTW, Kathy do you have any doceumntation ont he process of making the release ntoes?
2015-04-02T14:06:10  <kmlussier> There has been some talk among the devs of possibly doing release notes for point releases. That's something I might like to consider doing if I have time for the 2.8 point releases.
2015-04-02T14:06:24  <pinesol_green> [evergreen|Bill Erickson] 2.8 release notes creation and cleanup - <http://git.evergreen-ils.org/?p=Evergreen.git;a=commit;h=eee6a71>
2015-04-02T14:06:26  <kmlussier> yboston: No, I don't have documentation. Is this documentation for devs who are writing release note entries?
2015-04-02T14:06:35  <kmlussier> Ha, nice timing berick
2015-04-02T14:06:39  <yboston> no, for the documentation side
2015-04-02T14:06:45  <yboston> in case you ever need a sub
2015-04-02T14:07:07  <yboston> or help
2015-04-02T14:07:14  <kmlussier> No, I don't have documentation because, as long as the devs do their release notes, I don't do much other than read them for clarity and add acknowledgements.
2015-04-02T14:07:22  <kmlussier> I do go through the ChangeLog to make sure everything is there.
2015-04-02T14:07:27  <yboston> OK
2015-04-02T14:07:29  <kmlussier> I can add something to the wiki, though.
2015-04-02T14:07:33  <yboston> I thought it was more involved
2015-04-02T14:08:07  <yboston> if you have the time, even a high level overview could be helpful
2015-04-02T14:08:08  <kmlussier> No, I think what the RM does is a little more involved.
2015-04-02T14:08:18  <yboston> yes, I agree
2015-04-02T14:08:33  <kmlussier> In terms of generating the Release Notes, that is.
2015-04-02T14:08:49  <yboston> Robert did you want to mention anything?
2015-04-02T14:08:57  <rsoulliere> I have a couple of items.
2015-04-02T14:09:01  <yboston> go ahead
2015-04-02T14:09:03  <rsoulliere> #topic Conversion Coordinator Report

2015-04-02T14:09:58  <yboston> rsoulliere++
2015-04-02T14:09:59  <rsoulliere> #info I have also added the 2.8 database schema documentation.
2015-04-02T14:10:08  <rsoulliere> #info Links have been added to the documentaiton menu page:

2015-04-02T14:10:52  <rsoulliere> #questions any updates on the new doc servers?
2015-04-02T14:11:31  <yboston> I think the web group met yesterday
2015-04-02T14:11:49  <yboston> and they mentioned that they have an IP address and that thet need to still create the VM
2015-04-02T14:12:03  <yboston> kmlussier: where you at the meeting yesterday?
2015-04-02T14:12:19  <kmlussier> yes
2015-04-02T14:12:35  <yboston> am I remembering correctly that you know of?
2015-04-02T14:12:43  <kmlussier> Yes, that's what gmcharlt reported
2015-04-02T14:13:01  <yboston> kmlussier: thanks
2015-04-02T14:13:12  <yboston> I can follow up for next time to see what the progress is
2015-04-02T14:13:26  <yboston> #action yboston will check in on DIG VM
2015-04-02T14:13:54  <rsoulliere> OK, sounds good. That is all I had for today.
2015-04-02T14:14:05  <yboston> thanks
2015-04-02T14:14:16  <yboston> I will move on to past meetign action items
2015-04-02T14:14:40  <yboston> #topic past meeting action items
2015-04-02T14:14:47  <yboston> #info 1 ) yboston will reach out to krvmga for another copy of his docs to push to master
2015-04-02T14:15:00  <yboston> I did not get a chance to do this, will defer for next time
2015-04-02T14:15:22  <yboston> #info 2 ) kmlussier will complete the marc stream importer work and check on the status of the RDA docs
2015-04-02T14:15:43  <yboston> kmlussier: any updates ont his?
2015-04-02T14:15:52  <kmlussier> I need to defer for next time. My plan is to create my own DIG day to work on my to-do list
2015-04-02T14:16:02  <yboston> OK
2015-04-02T14:16:28  <yboston> #action kmlussier will complete the marc stream importer work and check on the status of the RDA docs
2015-04-02T14:17:05  <yboston> the next two items were assigned to remingtron; but I am not sure if he is here?
2015-04-02T14:17:19  <yboston> will defer them for now
2015-04-02T14:17:39  <yboston> #action remingtron will send out email to list about cahnging the file suffix in the docs repo to .asciidoc
2015-04-02T14:17:46  <yboston> #action remingtron will send an email to the list to consider changing the AsciiDoc section header style
2015-04-02T14:18:07  <yboston> the next item was for the whole group
2015-04-02T14:18:12  <yboston> #info 5 ) all decide how to proceed with docs reorganization next meeting
2015-04-02T14:18:22  *** jck_ has joined #evergreen
2015-04-02T14:18:30  <yboston> this might be a good topic of discussion at the conference
2015-04-02T14:18:55  <remingtron> #info remingtron is Remington Steed, Hekman Library (Calvin College)
2015-04-02T14:18:59  <remingtron> (sorry so late)
2015-04-02T14:19:02  <yboston> hola
2015-04-02T14:19:40  <remingtron> may I give a quick update on my two action items?
2015-04-02T14:19:41  <yboston> not sure  if you have read what we have gone over so far
2015-04-02T14:19:47  <yboston> go right ahead
2015-04-02T14:21:05  <remingtron> I have not initiated either of those conversations yet. I still plan to do the first, but not the second (header style syntax) since consensus was to allow individual choice, and I have come to agree
2015-04-02T14:21:18  <yboston> makes sense
2015-04-02T14:21:59  <remingtron> that's all I wanted to say :)
2015-04-02T14:22:20  <yboston> not sure how to cancel one for the defered actions with meetbot, but I on't think it is a big deal
2015-04-02T14:22:25  <yboston> thank remingtron
2015-04-02T14:23:15  <yboston> so right before remingtron joined us I had just brought up the topic of "5 ) all decide how to proceed with docs reorganization next meeting"
2015-04-02T14:23:39  <yboston> I had also mentioned this might be a good topic for the upcoming conference
2015-04-02T14:23:51  <yboston> any comments or questiosn about the re-org goal?
2015-04-02T14:24:13  <kmlussier> #info remingtron will NOT send email to the list to consider changing AsciiDoc section header because the consensus was to allow individual choice.
2015-04-02T14:24:17  <kmlussier> For the minutes. :)
2015-04-02T14:24:35  <remingtron> kmlussier++
2015-04-02T14:25:42  <yboston> we can also defer the topic of the re-org for next meeting, if that is what we want to do as group today
2015-04-02T14:25:43  <remingtron> I created a wiki page with some re-org ideas here:
2015-04-02T14:25:46  <remingtron> #link http://evergreen-ils.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=evergreen-docs:reorg_2014:audience_focused_layout
2015-04-02T14:26:24  <kmlussier> It seems like the in-person meeting is a great opportunity to discuss something like a doc reorg.
2015-04-02T14:26:31  <remingtron> I'd be glad for any input or reactions
2015-04-02T14:26:32  *** Newziky1 has left #evergreen
2015-04-02T14:26:52  <remingtron> and FYI, I'm not able to attend the conference this year
2015-04-02T14:26:57  <yboston> we need to plan to have a laptop to stream the meeting for those that cannot make it
2015-04-02T14:27:02  <remingtron> so I'll do my best to participate remotely
2015-04-02T14:27:10  <remingtron> yboston: thanks!
2015-04-02T14:27:18  <yboston> or a phone on speaker phone
2015-04-02T14:27:21  <yboston> (de nada)
2015-04-02T14:27:57  <yboston> remingtron: that links looks pretty good
2015-04-02T14:28:05  <yboston> *link
2015-04-02T14:28:22  <remingtron> all are welcome to edit and expand that wiki page
2015-04-02T14:29:08  <yboston> should we stay ont his topic or move on?
2015-04-02T14:29:45  <yboston> the other two major topics arae web clients and EG 2.8 new feature docs
2015-04-02T14:30:04  <remingtron> I'm happy to move on
2015-04-02T14:30:47  <yboston> good enough for me
2015-04-02T14:31:12  <yboston> #topic Progress on documenting new features in Evergreen 2.8
2015-04-02T14:31:23  <yboston> #link http://evergreen-ils.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=evergreen-docs:2.8_needs
2015-04-02T14:32:09  <kmlussier> I got about half-way through my assigned topics.
2015-04-02T14:32:11  <yboston> we still have a few features that need documenting.
2015-04-02T14:32:24  <yboston> I just realized I signed up for a second feature I need to document
2015-04-02T14:32:50  <kmlussier> I decided to do a new section regarding all billing OU settings, so it became a bigger project than I originally intended.
2015-04-02T14:32:59  <yboston> I see
2015-04-02T14:33:13  <yboston> that is what happens when adding new features :)
2015-04-02T14:33:30  <kmlussier> I also could document most of the items in the OPAC section, but I didn't want to sign up until I had finished my first two items. :)
2015-04-02T14:33:52  <yboston> some of those OPAC ones could be really simple, and great for a beguiner
2015-04-02T14:33:55  <kmlussier> Two of them are mine, so I feel a responsibility to document them.
2015-04-02T14:34:09  <kmlussier> yboston: Yes, I agree. I was thinking they would be good for a beginner too.
2015-04-02T14:34:27  <kmlussier> In some cases, it may just require checking to see if a screenshot needs to be replaced.
2015-04-02T14:35:10  <yboston> worse case scenario, we can use this low hanging fruit to give to newcomers at the conference. Though I am sure we would rather be done with 2.8 beofre the conference
2015-04-02T14:36:38  <yboston> also, thanks to I think remingtron for sending out reminders aout 2.8 new features ont he list
2015-04-02T14:37:44  <yboston> #action all finish outstanding EG 2.8 features listed here http://evergreen-ils.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=evergreen-docs:2.8_needs
2015-04-02T14:38:06  <yboston> should we switch to talking about web client docs?
2015-04-02T14:39:00  <remingtron> I have one comment
2015-04-02T14:39:09  <remingtron> (sorry, not paying close enough attention today!)
2015-04-02T14:39:25  <yboston> go ahead
2015-04-02T14:40:25  <remingtron> I realized that any time we don't document a feature on a given version, it's hard to remember to go back and work on those.
2015-04-02T14:40:34  <rjackson_isl> :q
2015-04-02T14:41:16  <yboston> remingtron: I agree
2015-04-02T14:41:18  <remingtron> I'd like to add a section at the bottom of the 2.8 docs needs wiki page called "From older versions" or such, which lists all outstanding docs features needing new docs
2015-04-02T14:41:22  <remingtron> thoughts?
2015-04-02T14:42:25  <yboston> I think it would be helpful
2015-04-02T14:43:01  <kmlussier> sure, why not?
2015-04-02T14:43:02  <yboston> though some of it would have to be moved over when we do the 2.9 page, though I don't think that is a problem
2015-04-02T14:43:42  <remingtron> okay, I'll work on that for 2.8 at least
2015-04-02T14:44:03  <yboston> should I make it an action item?
2015-04-02T14:44:11  <remingtron> then DIG can use that list at the conference for any outstanding items
2015-04-02T14:44:13  <remingtron> yboston: sure!
2015-04-02T14:44:24  <yboston> good idea
2015-04-02T14:45:37  <yboston> #action remingtron will add information of older outstanding doc needs to the 2.8 new feature doceumentation wiki page
2015-04-02T14:46:27  <yboston> any more questions/comments on EG 2.8 docs?
2015-04-02T14:47:08  <yboston> should we talk about the web client docs?
2015-04-02T14:47:16  <remingtron> sure, onward
2015-04-02T14:47:44  <yboston> thanks again to remingtron for sending out an email to remind folks to help reivew some web cleint ocs that were submitted
2015-04-02T14:47:52  <yboston> we should make that an "all" action item
2015-04-02T14:47:59  <yboston> for next meeting
2015-04-02T14:48:30  <kmlussier> Yes, I was just thinking of those. You can give that action item to me if you want.
2015-04-02T14:48:37  <kmlussier> And I promise I will follow through on that one. :)
2015-04-02T14:48:45  <remingtron> yboston: I'd put a higher priority on 2.8 docs, and suggest we wait on web client docs
2015-04-02T14:49:09  <yboston> remingtron: that makes sense;
2015-04-02T14:49:10  *** jck_ has quit IRC
2015-04-02T14:49:36  <yboston> we will have plenty of web client docs to work on at the conference
2015-04-02T14:49:46  <remingtron> but if kmlussier wants an action item, I will not stand in her way!
2015-04-02T14:50:06  <kmlussier> I just want to review the ones we have.
2015-04-02T14:50:19  <yboston> #action kmlussier will review submitted web client docs to be included in repository
2015-04-02T14:51:18  <yboston> any other comments or questions on the topic of web client docs or anything else?
2015-04-02T14:52:14  <remingtron> just the comment I added to the agenda
2015-04-02T14:52:34  <remingtron> that we no longer need to wait before backporting web client docs to live docs versions
2015-04-02T14:52:49  <remingtron> since ESI folks have published their remaining bugs on launchpad
2015-04-02T14:52:55  <kmlussier> We're backporting to 2.8 then?
2015-04-02T14:53:25  <remingtron> yes, for as much is included in 2.8, and then 2.9 as more comes outs, etc.
2015-04-02T14:54:23  <remingtron> though some have already been backported to 2.8
2015-04-02T14:55:43  <yboston> we are talking about doc commits?
2015-04-02T14:56:00  <remingtron> yes
2015-04-02T14:56:14  <yboston> but are we keeping the seperate web client docs sections?
2015-04-02T14:56:22  *** buzzy has quit IRC
2015-04-02T14:56:38  <remingtron> yes, still a "preview" version of the docs until the web client is more official
2015-04-02T14:56:49  <yboston> just makign sure
2015-04-02T14:56:58  <remingtron> yboston: good clarification
2015-04-02T14:57:06  <yboston> thank you
2015-04-02T14:57:16  <yboston> we are almost at the hour mark
2015-04-02T14:57:31  <yboston> any other commetns or questions before we wrap up?
2015-04-02T14:57:37  <remingtron> not from me
2015-04-02T14:58:25  <yboston> OK then, then I will wrap up
2015-04-02T14:58:36  <yboston> thank you everyone for attending

2015-04-02T16:09:25  <kmlussier> My favorite part of the Release Notes is adding the acknowledgements. Because that's where you see in one snapshop all of the different people and organizations that go into making a release happen.

2015-04-02T16:58:03  <kmlussier> Hmmm..I can push to the working repository, but when I try to make a doc commit directly to master, I get a message saying I cannot read from the remote repository.
2015-04-02T16:58:26  <yboston> kmlussier++
2015-04-02T16:59:30  <jeff> kmlussier: if you type "git remote -v" does your (push) url for the remote in question look like git@git.evergreen-ils.org:/Evergreen ?
2015-04-02T16:59:55  <kmlussier> Nope
2015-04-02T17:00:08  <kmlussier> git://git.evergreen-ils.org/Evergreen.git
2015-04-02T17:00:26  <kmlussier> Is it possible this is my first doc commit since moving to my new laptop in December? I've been negligent.
2015-04-02T17:00:44  <kmlussier> OK, let me try to figure this out on my own then. I think I can do it.
2015-04-02T17:00:51  <kmlussier> I WILL master git, even if it kills me.
2015-04-02T17:01:26  <jeff> if your remote is called "origin", and assuming things are proper on the server side of things already, you can try this: git remote set-url --push origin git@git.evergreen-ils.org:/Evergreen

2015-04-02T17:02:40  <jeff> worked? :-)
2015-04-02T17:02:53  <kmlussier> It sure did
2015-04-02T17:04:26  <kmlussier> Isn't there a quote in the database related to git killing people?

2015-04-02T17:05:54  <jeff> kmlussier: at least two

2015-04-02T17:05:56  <pinesol_green> jeff: Quote #1: "<senator> much as a cancer would develop from chewing on uranium rocks ... but the tooth decay is lovely!" (added by gmcharlt at 11:22 AM, February 17, 2011)
2015-04-02T17:05:58  <jeff> @quote get 24
2015-04-02T17:05:58  <pinesol_green> jeff: Quote #24: "<denials> when git doesn't kill you, it makes you smarter" (added by gmcharlt at 03:58 PM, May 03, 2012)
2015-04-02T17:06:37  * gmcharlt is a little concerned that jeff just happens to have to numbers handy

2015-04-02T17:07:16  <jeff> gmcharlt: i did my searches via privmsg to avoid cluttering up the channel :-)
2015-04-02T17:08:13  <gmcharlt> *whew*
2015-04-02T17:08:21  * mmorgan thought jeff must have had them all somewhere in jasperreports ;-)
2015-04-02T17:08:48  * kmlussier thinks jeff really did know them off the top of his head, but doesn't want to admit it. :)
2015-04-02T17:09:31  <jeff> the missing context from quote 1 is: <senator> my own understanding of the rebase question, the significance of fast-forwards and the consequences of squashing was stunted until it arose organically through habitual git use
2015-04-02T17:09:50  <kmlussier> jeff: Thank you for that. I was just looking for it, but I couldn't remember how to get to the old logs.
