2015-04-09T11:45:18  <mmorgan> Can anyone point me to where to change the registered workstation in a mac client?
2015-04-09T11:45:56  <mmorgan> Think I have done it in the past, but can't locate the info :-(
2015-04-09T11:46:55  <RoganH> I'll look on mine but usually they're in ~/Library/Preferences
2015-04-09T11:47:38  <bshum> If it was me, and it was a one time thing
2015-04-09T11:47:51  <bshum> I would just change the hostname slightly.
2015-04-09T11:47:56  <bshum> And re-register.
2015-04-09T11:48:18  <bshum> Like do a capital letter in the hostname instead of all lower-case, etc.
2015-04-09T11:48:19  <RoganH> Thee's a file called org.evergreen-ils.Evergreen.pllist there.  I haven't tried it (since I'm logged into mine right now) but I'd try deleting that.
2015-04-09T11:48:33  <jeff> ~/Library/Application\ Support/open_ils_staff_client/
2015-04-09T11:48:33  <pinesol_green> jeff: I am only a bot, please don't think I'm intelligent :)
2015-04-09T11:49:06  <RoganH> If you want to register to another server or keeping the old one doesn't matter bshum 's idea is easier and in many ways better
2015-04-09T11:49:19  <RoganH> If you want to wipe the information from the machine the plist
2015-04-09T11:49:43  <jeff> The file you want will be ws_info, it'll be in Profiles/[random].default/chrome/ws_info or similar
2015-04-09T11:50:22  <jeff> this may be the fastest command to find the full path, [random] bit and all (it may turn up multiple results if you have multiple profiles): find ~/Library/Application\ Support/open_ils_staff_client -name ws_info
2015-04-09T11:53:30  <jeff> the file ~/Library/Preferences/org.evergreen-ils.Evergreen.plist contains settings unrelated to your current need.
2015-04-09T11:54:16  <tsbere> I personally like "hostname/blah" where blah is changeable. Because then you don't have to worry about "slightly changing" the hostname. I tend to go with hostname/shortname myself....
2015-04-09T11:54:30  *** Newziky has quit IRC
2015-04-09T11:54:43  <jeff> There is also last_ws_server, in the same directory as ws_info. That simply contains a key corresponding to one of the entries in ws_info.
2015-04-09T11:54:56  * tsbere wrote that feature in because of his dislike for the "slightly change the hostname and/or enter aliases into dns and/or the hosts on the machine" methods
2015-04-09T11:55:11  <jeff> tsbere: likewise. server.example.org/BR1 server.example.org/BR2 etc
2015-04-09T11:56:36  <mmorgan> Sorry, got pulled away for a phone call. Reading up.

2015-04-09T12:06:07  <gmcharlt> bshum: I'm in the process of creating a total of 5 bugs and their corresponding branches
2015-04-09T12:06:11  <mmorgan> Thanks for all the suggestions. In the interest of speed and ease, going with the "hostname/blah" approach suggested by tsbere. Will delve into the file system later (maybe):)
2015-04-09T12:06:39  <bshum> gmcharlt: Sounds good, we'll take a look at them after they're up and help get them signed and pushed along.  Thanks!

2015-04-09T12:13:58  <Dyrcona> The hostname/shortname trick is nice for central site staff who want to login as certain locations for troubleshooting purposes.
2015-04-09T12:18:56  * kmlussier has been using the shortname trick since seeing it in use at MVLC.
2015-04-09T12:19:04  <mmorgan> Dyrcona: We use the profile manager on Windows machines at central site to maintain different profiles for different locations, but not on our smattering of macs. Not sure if it can be set up similarly on macs.
2015-04-09T12:19:59  <Dyrcona> mmorgan: You can use profile manager on Mac and on Linux. It isn't necessary with the /shortname trick.
2015-04-09T12:20:37  <Dyrcona> I use /shortname to register my workstation at the branch represented by the shortname.
2015-04-09T12:20:45  <mmorgan> Sometimes it's useful to have the entire profile, including column settings, receipt templates, etc., not just the workstation registration.
2015-04-09T12:21:25  * jeff nods
2015-04-09T12:21:29  <Dyrcona> Yes, but you need to get that from the branch in question.
2015-04-09T12:21:32  <jeff> we use both for different purposes.
2015-04-09T12:21:51  <bshum> Ooh, /shortname
2015-04-09T12:21:54  <mmorgan> The /shortname trick will definitely be handy for some purposes.
2015-04-09T12:21:56  <bshum> Now that I didn't think of...
2015-04-09T12:22:02  <jeff> bshum: hmm?
2015-04-09T12:22:09  <bshum> I didn't try that before.
2015-04-09T12:22:19  <bshum> What they're talking about up there with hostname/shortname
2015-04-09T12:22:19  <Dyrcona> I am usually not troubleshooting things affected by the profile.
2015-04-09T12:22:37  *** ericar_ has joined #evergreen
2015-04-09T12:22:37  <Dyrcona> Yeah, it's very handy.
2015-04-09T12:23:32  <Dyrcona> You don't have to use the shortname, any unique string will do, but the shortname helps keep it clear where you've registered the workstation.
2015-04-09T12:23:55  <bshum> Yeah
2015-04-09T12:24:05  <bshum> That's quite helpful, indeed.
2015-04-09T12:24:45  <jeff> don't feel too bad. it didn't exist until 2011, commit 5b702c3 :-)

2015-04-09T13:12:50  <krvmga> i'm just looking at our 2.7 test installation and no icons are appearing for any items in search returns in the opac. i don't know why.
2015-04-09T13:13:47  <bshum> krvmga: Well, two thoughts:  (1) did you guys monkey with any format_icon configuration in the settings, or (2) did you perform a reingest of all your bibs.
2015-04-09T13:14:10  <krvmga> bshum: we just finished a re-ingest of all our bibs
2015-04-09T13:14:22  <krvmga> bshum: format_icon configuration in the settings?
2015-04-09T13:14:33  <bshum> Or is it icon_format
2015-04-09T13:14:35  <bshum> I never can remember.
2015-04-09T13:14:41  <krvmga> i'm not sure where to find that.
2015-04-09T13:15:06  <kmlussier> krvmga: We should have some docs on that. Let me check.
2015-04-09T13:15:25  <bshum> "icon_format" is right.

2015-04-09T13:19:11  <kmlussier> krvmga: If it's an ESI project, as this was, there's usually documentation that goes along with it. :)
2015-04-09T13:19:42  <krvmga> of course, now i need to figure out what to do...
2015-04-09T13:20:04  <kmlussier> krvmga: If you didn't change any settings, all of those icon format settings should just be there.
2015-04-09T13:20:29  <krvmga> kmlussier: i didn't change anything...but they aren't there.
2015-04-09T13:20:41  <krvmga> i mean, the icons don't show
2015-04-09T13:20:47  <kmlussier> My first place to check would be  to check on the reingest.
2015-04-09T13:20:52  <bshum> So maybe something went wrong with the reingest process.
2015-04-09T13:21:06  <krvmga> bshum: oh, please don't say that.
2015-04-09T13:21:09  <krvmga> lol
2015-04-09T13:21:43  <bshum> I mean, what command did you use?  Maybe you reingested the wrong portions of your records?  Or you needed a full reingest and it only did partial on only certain metabib flags/fields
2015-04-09T13:23:35  <krvmga> equinox did our re-ingest
2015-04-09T13:23:51  *** bmills1 has quit IRC
2015-04-09T13:23:57  <bshum> krvmga: Maybe you should ask them what they did then.  :)
2015-04-09T13:24:00  <krvmga> i'm pretty sure they did a full re-ingest
2015-04-09T13:24:08  *** bmills has joined #evergreen
2015-04-09T13:24:13  <kmlussier> krvmga: I would file a support ticket with them
2015-04-09T13:24:28  <kmlussier> They'll be able to speak more knowledgeably about it since they performed the reingest.
2015-04-09T13:29:05  <krvmga> kmlussier: we're putting in a ticket now.
2015-04-09T13:30:18  <bshum> krvmga: For fun, what happens if you edit a single bib (like add something extra to it or remove something) and then save it.  (that ought to force a reingest on a single bib)
2015-04-09T13:31:23  <kmlussier> Of course, it could also be your bib records not having the right fixed fields data. But I wouldn't expect that to be the culprit if you see no icons at all.
2015-04-09T13:32:13  <bshum> Or maybe it's a template problem.  Do you use customizations on the server?  (maybe the code to display the icon went poof???!)
2015-04-09T13:32:19  <bshum> :)
2015-04-09T13:34:59  <kmlussier> Yeah, old templates are always good to look into right after an upgrade.
2015-04-09T13:37:00  <dbs> thanks for the plusses earlier, folks. very kind of you

2015-04-09T14:01:18  <krvmga> ok, equinox dealt with the icon problem by cancelling all the customizations on the site and returning it to vanilla.
2015-04-09T14:01:43  <krvmga> this means that somewhere in all those files is likely one file - or even one line in one file - that was causing the problem
2015-04-09T14:01:54  <kmlussier> krvmga: Look at what I posted to you above

2015-04-09T14:35:18  <berick> kmlussier: depends on what you mean by standing order...  i think of standing orders as repeating, say, every year.
2015-04-09T14:35:47  <berick> this is more like "give me $X of children's materials and I don't care what they are or if I get them all at once"
2015-04-09T14:36:08  <berick> but it does not automatically create a new order every year
2015-04-09T14:36:50  *** krvmga has quit IRC
2015-04-09T14:41:17  <kmlussier> berick: OK, thanks. I wasn't thinking of something that needs to repeat, but something like Autotically Yours that ships certain titles, like bestsellers, automatically. I think libraries may budget a certain amount for those orders, though I'm not clear on that.
2015-04-09T14:41:57  <berick> kmlussier: i'm not familiar w/ that specifically, but it sounds like it might be the same thing
2015-04-09T14:42:43  <kmlussier> It looks intriguing. I've sent a link to the proposal to our acq people here and asked them to post feedback if they had any.
2015-04-09T14:43:02  <berick> very cool, thanks kmlussier
2015-04-09T14:43:23  <berick> i've started coding to make sure what I'm trying to do makes sense.  so far, so good
2015-04-09T14:57:39  <kmlussier> yboston: I did ask about meeting space at the conference for the Academics for Evergreen group. But I never heard back.

2015-04-09T15:42:24  <jeff> What is the latest version of xulrunner for Mac OS X that we should try for 2.7.4?
2015-04-09T15:42:51  <bshum> jeff: So... I never tested anything beyond what we use now for the other clients, that's 14.0.1
2015-04-09T15:43:01  <bshum> That's not true, I tried up through XUL 17 or so
2015-04-09T15:43:07  <bshum> And there were let's say... bugs and crashes.
2015-04-09T15:43:17  <bshum> So at least on 14, you'll be where everyone else is.
2015-04-09T15:44:08  * bshum is fairly sure the Mac client building instructions on the wiki reflect that XUL 14 version.
2015-04-09T15:47:17  <jeff> co-worker mentioned that the instructions they were looking at mentioned evergreen 2.3, so they were... undertain of the doc's relevance.
2015-04-09T15:47:24  * jeff looks
2015-04-09T15:47:26  <jeff> bshum++
2015-04-09T15:48:37  <bshum> They are old docs, but Xulrunner testing hasn't progressed since then.  Since after XUL 18 or so, I think that's when remote XUL goes away and things die.
2015-04-09T15:49:12  <bshum> I do sometimes think that XUL 15 might be a better choice though, since that's the version of Firefox where they fixed all the broken memory issues with Firefox 14.
2015-04-09T15:49:43  <bshum> But when we tested XUL 15 built staff clients in production at one library, the staff client would occasionally, spontaneously close without warning.

2015-04-09T16:19:59  <kmlussier> Is there any way we can make the text wrap there?
2015-04-09T16:20:33  *** collum has quit IRC
2015-04-09T16:22:15  <tsbere> kmlussier: pre-wrap instead of pre in the CSS?
2015-04-09T16:22:37  * kmlussier doesn't think this is working the way it's intended.
2015-04-09T16:23:43  * tsbere doesn't know how it is intended to work, nor how it is working, but sees that the css says "pre" which doesn't (I believe) wrap, but preserves line breaks and spaces. "pre-wrap" is supposed to be "pre, but wrap lines" as far as I recall
2015-04-09T16:23:57  <gmcharlt> indeed
2015-04-09T16:24:02  <gmcharlt> kmlussier: quick screenshot?
2015-04-09T16:24:14  <kmlussier> Yeah. I'm working on it now
2015-04-09T16:27:02  <kmlussier> This is a long public note on the server with the patch. It's running off the screen. http://www.screencast.com/t/6j3o8LjZEyI
2015-04-09T16:27:17  <kmlussier> When I add the same note on a server with a clean version of master, it's wrapping into a nice little paragraph.

2015-04-09T16:35:40  <kmlussier> That looks better! :)
2015-04-09T16:36:01  <gmcharlt> the change was in fact to use pre-wrap
2015-04-09T16:36:31  <gmcharlt> and that accommodates the best of both words: if the message template inentionally contains line breaks, they won't get smushed
2015-04-09T16:38:01  <kmlussier> Ah, I see.

2015-04-09T16:58:28  <hopkinsju> Does anyone have a quick way to count records in a marc file using yaz-marcdump or some other command line?
2015-04-09T16:58:38  <hopkinsju> I'm pretty sure I've heard gmcharlt talk about doing this
2015-04-09T16:59:19  <gmcharlt> hopkinsju: yaz-marcdump -o marcxml foo.mrc | grep -c '<record'
2015-04-09T16:59:22  <eeevil> yaz-marcdump -f MARC-8 -t UTF-8 -o marcxml marc21.raw|grep '<record'|wc -l

2015-04-09T16:59:40  <gmcharlt> eeevil: TOO SLOW

2015-04-09T17:00:07  <eeevil> well, back in MY DAY grep didn't have -c #getoffmylawn
2015-04-09T17:00:16  <hopkinsju> I was actually thinking that same thing eeevil, but I think gmcharlt knows of a magical control character that I can't seem to find
