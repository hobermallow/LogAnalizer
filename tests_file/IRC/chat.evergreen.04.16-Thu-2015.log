2015-04-16T09:24:03  <Stompro> Good morning all, can anyone point me to documentation on setting up a multi brick install?  Or answer some general questions about it?  Does each brick run everything that a stand alone system runs except for the DB?  So each brick runs ejabberd stand alone so to speak?
2015-04-16T09:24:23  <csharp> Stompro: correct
2015-04-16T09:24:24  *** mmorgan has joined #evergreen
2015-04-16T09:25:13  <tsbere> I will note that the ejabberd instances need to be able to communicate with one another if you are load balancing between bricks.
2015-04-16T09:25:46  <csharp> Stompro: a "brick" originally was a "head" which runs apache and 2 "drones" that ran OpenSRF. In our case they were connected by putting /openils on an NFS share shared between the three servers
2015-04-16T09:26:08  <tsbere> Stompro / csharp: Also, don't you need a common memcache normally?
2015-04-16T09:26:18  <Stompro> So each brick can be setup with the private opensrf domains like step 7 in the instructions?  http://tinyurl.com/k5twkbp
2015-04-16T09:26:32  <Stompro> Err, that would be a no.
2015-04-16T09:26:57  <csharp> tsbere: yep - in our case, we have two non-redundant memcache servers
2015-04-16T09:27:34  <tsbere> Stompro: I think you will want thinks like private.brick1/public.brick1, private.brick2/public.brick2, etc so they can be set up to communicate with one another.
2015-04-16T09:28:28  <csharp> Stompro: it's been several years since I actually set up a head + drones brick - we've been running on single-server "bricks" (though technically that's now a misnomer)
2015-04-16T09:28:58  <csharp> i.e., if it's one server, it's no longer a "brick" ;-)
2015-04-16T09:29:33  <tsbere> Stompro: I suppose each brick needs potential access to shared storage for things like reporter output, uploading offline circs, etc. I have never set up a "multi-brick" setup so I am not 100% sure what is needed there.
2015-04-16T09:29:48  <tsbere> csharp: Why can't a single server be a "brick"?
2015-04-16T09:30:11  <csharp> fwiw, GenaSYS (the cluster build system we use at GPLS/PINES) does the head + drone setup automatically: http://git.evergreen-ils.org/?p=contrib/pines/genasys.git;a=summary
2015-04-16T09:30:38  <Dyrcona> Well, if you think about, a single server would be a brick, if you look at "brick" as an atomic unit of build materials.
2015-04-16T09:30:58  <Dyrcona> A cluster of bricks would be well, bricks.
2015-04-16T09:30:59  <csharp> tsbere: it can be, but I know the term "brick" was originally used to refer to multiple servers acting as a single entity
2015-04-16T09:31:19  <Dyrcona> But maybe that's just from doing masonry and carpentry work as a teanager/young adult.
2015-04-16T09:32:15  <csharp> I'm not sure the term "brick" would have been used if each what-is-now-known-as-"brick" had been a single server
2015-04-16T09:32:39  <Dyrcona> Well, just don't brick your bricks. :)
2015-04-16T09:32:48  <csharp> that's all academic though - we still name our servers "brick01-head", etc.
2015-04-16T09:33:05  <Dyrcona> Or bh1 and bh2 as I've seen at one site.
2015-04-16T09:34:50  <Dyrcona> S'pose you could consider 1 physical server a "brick" if you're running all the pieces on vms on that server....
2015-04-16T09:34:54  <Dyrcona> Meh. Words.
2015-04-16T09:35:11  <csharp> right ;-)
2015-04-16T09:37:12  <Dyrcona> Speaking of building VMs.... I'm going to build two today to test csharp's changes for Safe.pm.
2015-04-16T09:37:28  <csharp> it's also worth considering that virtual machines have become dominant enough that it's worth reconsidering cluster architecture
2015-04-16T09:37:38  *** yboston has joined #evergreen
2015-04-16T09:37:43  <Stompro> Thanks for the info all.
2015-04-16T09:38:07  <Dyrcona> Yeah, we're buying 5 machines next week and we're considering a couple of different configurations.
2015-04-16T09:38:11  <csharp> awitter has been experimenting with glusterfs as a way to share a single /openils across a row of app servers
2015-04-16T09:39:10  <csharp> but we don't have anything like that beyond a bare prototyping phase
2015-04-16T09:40:40  <Dyrcona> We were looking at running a master ejabberd with slaves (not sure that
2015-04-16T09:40:47  <Dyrcona> 's the term they use).
2015-04-16T09:42:48  <eeevil> so, as the guy what coined the term "brick" WRT evergreen and pines I can say that, originally, it meant "a unit of Evergreen that is self contained and can be a load balancing member" ;) ... but, definitions change, of course
2015-04-16T09:44:58  <eeevil> the reason for head+drone was that, when CPUs were slower and RAM was smaller, it was a GoodThing(tm) to separate apache from opensrf, as they have,  um, competing and non-complementary resource profiles
2015-04-16T09:45:40  <csharp> eeevil++
2015-04-16T09:48:16  <eeevil> (and, IMO, it's still a GoodThing(tm) to separate applications with competing resource profiles onto separate servers/VMs/containers/whatever ... but that's not special to evergreen, it's just ye ol' proper resource allocation)
2015-04-16T09:50:14  <mmorgan> Quick web client question anyone? Do I need to be registered to a workstation to login?
2015-04-16T09:50:25  <mmorgan> Have a meeting in 10 minutes
2015-04-16T09:50:36  * csharp was able to log into webby without first setting up a workstation
2015-04-16T09:51:27  <mmorgan> Screen is just refreshing at the login page. Maybe I'm doing something wrong.
2015-04-16T09:51:30  <kmlussier> mmorgan: You can log in without a workstation, but last I saw there were some bugs that appeared if you did not register a workstation.
2015-04-16T09:51:38  <kmlussier> mmorgan: What browser are you in?
2015-04-16T09:51:49  <mmorgan> Tried FF and Chrome
2015-04-16T09:52:15  * kmlussier wishes there was a way to require workstation registration in the web client.
2015-04-16T09:53:01  * mmorgan does too, but right now, I'd love to login. Different computer that hasn't logged into it before.
2015-04-16T09:53:07  * csharp thinks it should use a similar mechanism to the selfcheck, which prompts you to register one when you first log in
2015-04-16T09:53:44  <kmlussier> mmorgan: Sorry! I don't have an answer. :(
2015-04-16T09:53:51  <csharp> https://<yourhostnamehere>/eg/circ/selfcheck/main
2015-04-16T09:53:59  <kmlussier> And I guess you can't register the workstation if you can't log in.
2015-04-16T09:54:10  * kmlussier doesn't like that bit either.
2015-04-16T09:54:37  <Dyrcona> Well, that's the same as the current staff client.
2015-04-16T09:54:55  <Dyrcona> Your workstation is registered "locally" and in the database.
2015-04-16T09:54:56  <csharp> mmorgan: I was able to log into webby last Thursday without a problem, but I've seen the same issue you're seeing too
2015-04-16T09:55:11  *** RoganH has joined #evergreen
2015-04-16T09:55:19  <Dyrcona> Can't register it in the database if you can't login.
2015-04-16T09:55:29  * csharp makes the excuse to his demo-ees that the server is "constantly under development"
2015-04-16T09:55:45  <mmorgan> Oh! https!! Working now!
2015-04-16T09:55:49  <mmorgan> Thanks all
2015-04-16T09:55:55  * mmorgan runs off to meeting.
2015-04-16T09:56:28  <kmlussier> Ah, https. That one gets us all the time.
2015-04-16T09:57:58  <kmlussier> Dyrcona: I should restate that. It isn't so much that you have to log in. It's that there isn't a quick option to register the workstation right from the login screen.
2015-04-16T09:58:26  <kmlussier> It just adds a few steps to the workstation registration process. Especially in those places where the login that registers the workstation isn't the same login that will be using the workstation.
2015-04-16T09:58:40  *** RoganH has quit IRC
2015-04-16T09:58:54  <Dyrcona> Well, the current staff client gives you the illusion that it is done in one step, but it really isn't.
2015-04-16T09:59:13  <Dyrcona> Anyway, I get what you're saying, and it might be nice to have it right there.
2015-04-16T10:01:21  <eeevil> mmorgan: you don't need one to log in, but you need one for it to work correctly (sorry, just saw this)
2015-04-16T10:01:34  <eeevil> kmlussier: I'll be making it really required soon

2015-04-16T11:09:44  <yboston> makes sense
2015-04-16T11:09:51  <bshum> And store the changes as git commits
2015-04-16T11:09:57  <bshum> So that you can quickly rebase them as necessary

2015-04-16T11:10:18  <yboston> what year is it?
2015-04-16T11:10:19  <bshum> And copy/move the commits from rel_2_7 to whatever future based branches you need.
2015-04-16T11:10:28  <bshum> It's still 2015 over here.
2015-04-16T11:10:33  <bshum> Anyways...

2015-04-16T11:53:35  <Bmagic> You can use one or the other, but not both. So if the bug fix is commited, then the code for the new feature would need to reverse that commit with it's commit. If that makes sense?

2015-04-16T13:23:44  <dbs> no, nothing's clickable in the notification
2015-04-16T13:25:21  <phasefx> looks like the image from my personal phasefx account.. nothing in my google drive trash :(
2015-04-16T13:25:49  <dbs> Yeah, it would have been in the Drive trash bin for 10 or 30 days or whatever before being completely purged

2015-04-16T13:26:24  <phasefx> work related, I've kept QA talk and receipt talk on there
2015-04-16T13:27:06  <dbs> no real worries here, fwiw; it's just one of the first times I've seen a "permanently deleted" notification :)

2015-04-16T14:06:04  <buzzy> greetings from the oregon library association conference! we're in crunch time for conference planning. hopefully you all received the budget earlier today
2015-04-16T14:06:12  <bbqben> #info http://list.evergreen-ils.org/pipermail/eg-oversight-board/2015-April/001002.html
2015-04-16T14:06:34  <bbqben> Hi buzzy - thx for joining us
2015-04-16T14:06:40  <buzzy> attendance is low, unfortunately. 112 people. nonetheless, we're hoping for a great conference.
2015-04-16T14:06:41  <buzzy> hi!
2015-04-16T14:07:06  <buzzy> we're getting last minute sponsors in. we got two gold-level sponsorships in the last week, actually
2015-04-16T14:07:16  <buzzy> and i'm hitting up vendors while i'm at ola
2015-04-16T14:07:38  <buzzy> we're working on the logistics and program now, the nitty gritty details
2015-04-16T14:08:27  <kmlussier> buzzy: I have a question about the budget you sent out earlier.
2015-04-16T14:08:38  <buzzy> i did want to ask you guys when you'd like to have your eob meeting. we've got some rooms set aside, but if there's a particular day/time that you have the conference meeting, i'll make sure that we set it aside for you.
2015-04-16T14:08:39  <buzzy> shoot
2015-04-16T14:08:49  <kmlussier> The food totals there, do they reflect the food & beverage minimum?
2015-04-16T14:09:11  <bbqben> buzzy, we set to meet 14.05.15 @ 1900 Pacific
2015-04-16T14:09:32  <bbqben> great if we can find a space with a phone line JIC folks need to dial in
2015-04-16T14:09:49  <buzzy> no, those are the numbers that we have based on attendance. because attendance is lower than budgeted, we'll be discussing the issue with the venue.
2015-04-16T14:09:56  <buzzy> i
2015-04-16T14:10:05  <buzzy> i'll check on that, bbqben
2015-04-16T14:10:28  <kmlussier> Given that we're so close to conference time, I would like to see a worst-case scenario budget. Basically, if the venue doesn't budge on the minimum, how bad does it look?
2015-04-16T14:10:42  <buzzy> hold please
2015-04-16T14:10:50  <buzzy> assuming no further sponsorships?
2015-04-16T14:11:03  <kmlussier> Also, it appears as if the budget doesn't account for all of the signed sponsorship agreements we have.
2015-04-16T14:11:33  <kmlussier> buzzy: Yes, assuming no further sponsorships. I don't think we need to see it now if you don't have it ready, but I think it would be good to see all the numbers as they stand now.
2015-04-16T14:12:03  <buzzy> okay. to which sponsorships are you referring?
2015-04-16T14:12:27  <buzzy> i was somewhat rushed this morning, given the conference, so i likely missed something. i apologize
2015-04-16T14:12:42  <yboston> #info yboston is Yamil Suarez - Berklee Colege of Music
2015-04-16T14:13:12  <kmlussier> It looks like you just have one $4,000 Platinum sponsorship there. But I could be reading it wrong.
2015-04-16T14:13:20  <buzzy> i will try to send out a worst case scenario budget by monday, if that's all right.
2015-04-16T14:13:55  <kmlussier> sure
2015-04-16T14:14:33  <bbqben> any other q's for buzzy?
2015-04-16T14:14:40  <bbqben> great to see the shuttle lists posted
2015-04-16T14:14:53  <montgoc1> Yes

2015-04-16T14:16:03  <buzzy> ah, you're correct, kathy. thank you!
2015-04-16T14:16:07  <montgoc1> Can that get removed?
2015-04-16T14:16:24  <buzzy> yes, i'll ask brent to handle that
2015-04-16T14:16:39  <montgoc1> Cool. Thanks.

2015-04-16T14:32:21  <bbqben> kmlussier over to you
2015-04-16T14:32:39  <kmlussier> The committee isn't official, but the members already had the name discussion. So we've revised the proposal to call it Outreach, rather than Public Relations.
2015-04-16T14:32:54  *** dbs has quit IRC
2015-04-16T14:32:57  <kmlussier> I think we need a vote to formally accept the proposal. Sorry, I wasn't thinking of that last time around.
2015-04-16T14:33:34  <kmlussier> The EOB is also charged with appointing members, so I think we need a vote to appoint RoganH, graced, Amy Terlaga, Ron Gagnon and me to the committee.
2015-04-16T14:33:47  <kmlussier> That is, if you're ok with us serving on the committee.
2015-04-16T14:33:53  <kmlussier> I think that's it.
2015-04-16T14:33:57  <bbqben> kmlussier - thanks. Any discussion before we call these votes?
2015-04-16T14:34:16  <kmlussier> Almost forgot. Our first real conference call is tomorrow. I'll be posting updates as we go along.

2015-04-16T14:42:12  <csharp> once again, kmlussier++
2015-04-16T14:42:16  <kmlussier> I was hoping to have these somewhat finalized by today, but I think they still need a little work.

2015-04-16T14:43:06  <yboston> kmlussier++
2015-04-16T14:43:13  <kmlussier> We've made a lot of progress on this. I think the big discussion Valerie Aurora wanted us to have was to ensure that the Safety Committee is empowered to make decisions when it comes to people in leadership positions.
2015-04-16T14:43:21  <kmlussier> Thanks all! :)
2015-04-16T14:43:59  <kmlussier> We've had that discussion among ourselves (ourselves being Safety Commitee and incident responders), but I just want to put it out there for the EOB to see if there were any thoughts on it.
2015-04-16T14:44:46  <kmlussier> I think gmcharlt had an excellent idea of having people in leadership roles actually signing off on the CoC and agreeing to sanctions handed down by the Safety Committee. Appeals can be made to the EOB.
2015-04-16T14:44:52  <kmlussier> So that's the direction we're heading.
2015-04-16T14:45:35  <kmlussier> Now that I think of it, nearly everyone participating in the EOB meeting today  was already brought into that discussion earlier. :)
2015-04-16T14:46:28  <kmlussier> I want to polish it a bit more. At some point, either today or via email, I think we need to appoint the Safety Committee reps.
2015-04-16T14:46:43  <bbqben> kmlussier thanks for looping us all in
2015-04-16T14:47:10  <kmlussier> I also would like you all to consider my recommendation that we donate $200 to the Ada Initiative as a thank you for reviewing our procedures and meeting with the people who volunteered to be incident responders.
2015-04-16T14:47:55  <kmlussier> The Ada Initiative has done a lot of great work getting conferences to create and implement Codes of Conduct and depends on donations to keep their operations going.
2015-04-16T14:49:03  <yboston> My only concern is making sure enough people have copies of these procedures handy during the cnference. I don't expect it would be hard to have copies of the procedures handy in the "registration area"
2015-04-16T14:49:23  <kmlussier> yboston: They will be in the printed program.
2015-04-16T14:49:36  <yboston> great
2015-04-16T14:49:57  <kmlussier> I'm also planning to write a blog post ahead of time. I think we also have some time to talk about them during the Thursday morning session, before the keynote.
2015-04-16T14:50:07  <kmlussier> I'll need to re-confirm that, though.
2015-04-16T14:50:24  <kmlussier> I basically want everyone to see the faces of the incident responders.
2015-04-16T14:50:51  <kmlussier> Given the time, I think we can hold off on appointing Safety Committee members and do it via email. But would we be able to vote on the donation today?
2015-04-16T14:51:22  <bbqben> any discussion about the donation before we call a vote?
2015-04-16T14:51:57  <bbqben> FWIW - don't see any policy/guidleines in this regard for us to be aware of, but happy to be corrected
2015-04-16T14:53:01  <bbqben> hearing none...

2015-04-16T14:56:16  <bbqben> graced over to you
2015-04-16T14:56:28  <graced> Good afternoon
2015-04-16T14:56:32  <graced> :)
2015-04-16T14:56:35  <bbqben> indeed
2015-04-16T14:56:46  <graced> We have two great proposals that the site selection committee reviewed.
2015-04-16T14:56:51  *** Newziky has joined #evergreen
2015-04-16T14:57:09  *** Dyrcona has quit IRC
2015-04-16T14:57:18  <graced> We are ready to make a recommendation but would like to move it to a private discussion with the EOB if that is agreeable.
2015-04-16T14:57:48  <yboston> fine with me
2015-04-16T14:57:49  <graced> We wouldn't want the sites to find out the were selected or not selected in this IRC meeting
2015-04-16T14:57:54  <kmlussier> I'm fine with that.
2015-04-16T14:58:00  <bbqben> makes sense
2015-04-16T14:58:13  <abneiman> Sounds good
2015-04-16T14:58:47  <graced> I'm afraid I will have to ask montgoc1 to recuse himself from that discussion though since he's a proposal submitter.
2015-04-16T14:59:08  <montgoc1> No problem.
2015-04-16T14:59:14  <graced> IF that is agreeable, I will follow up with an email.
2015-04-16T14:59:25  <graced> Questions or concerns?
2015-04-16T14:59:31  <csharp> looks like we're all in agreement on that
2015-04-16T14:59:35  <bbqben> cool, so to confirm graced will follow up with EOB members via email
2015-04-16T14:59:56  <bbqben> thanks to montgoc1 for bowing out on that

2015-04-16T15:02:28  <bbqben> #Topic New Business - Lanyards for EG2015 etc
2015-04-16T15:02:34  <bbqben> graced over to you again
2015-04-16T15:02:46  <graced> I'd like to propose that the EOB consider budgeting for (and paying for)  the new lanyards in bulk and not on a per conference basis.  Since these lanyards tie into the photography policy and will be used for many years to come it makes sense to me to budget for it and buy in bulk.
2015-04-16T15:03:03  <graced> There isn't really a vendor sponsorship opportunity attached to it any more, so it's a known recurring expense which, to me, makes it unique. And it will be one less thing for local committees to deal with.
2015-04-16T15:03:14  <graced> Thoughts?
2015-04-16T15:03:19  <bbqben> graced - quantos deniros?
2015-04-16T15:03:30  <graced> kmlussier: what were the final numbers?
2015-04-16T15:03:43  <abneiman>  I imagine it's probably far cheaper to buy in bulk, yeah?
2015-04-16T15:03:47  * graced has an accomplice
2015-04-16T15:04:03  <kmlussier> It's $1,250 to purchase 500 green, 250 yellow, 250 red.
2015-04-16T15:04:18  <yboston> I like that it also opens up an opportunity to reuse items / reduce waste
2015-04-16T15:04:22  <graced> abneiman, yes indeed - and most shops have minimums of 250
2015-04-16T15:04:24  <kmlussier> As a reminder, green means it's okay to take a photo, yellow means a person must ask first, and 250 means no photos.
2015-04-16T15:04:26  <graced> per color
2015-04-16T15:04:46  <bbqben> graced 3750 all-in?
2015-04-16T15:04:56  <kmlussier> With the red and yellow, we're not really seeing a savings because we're getting the minimum. There is a savings with the green.
2015-04-16T15:05:04  <kmlussier> I expect most people will choose green.
2015-04-16T15:05:11  <graced> $1,250 I think
2015-04-16T15:05:29  <kmlussier> Yes, the total for all of them is $1,250
2015-04-16T15:05:46  <kmlussier> We were thinking they could also be used for other Evergreen events, like the hack-a-way.
2015-04-16T15:05:59  <graced> Of course we can order more and see greater savings
2015-04-16T15:06:00  <graced> I will happily volunteer Equinox to ship the lanyards to each conference site and store them between conferences.
2015-04-16T15:06:36  <bbqben> seems like a no-brainer. Shall we call a vote?
2015-04-16T15:06:58  <kmlussier> Sounds good to me, but, bear in mind, I'm the accomplice. :)

2015-04-16T15:14:54  <kmlussier> krvmga: Did you get an answer to your earlier question regarding the All Books filter?
2015-04-16T15:15:06  <csharp> @karma all y'all
2015-04-16T15:15:06  <pinesol_green> csharp: Karma for "all y'all" has been increased 2 times and decreased 0 times for a total karma of 2.
2015-04-16T15:15:24  <krvmga> kmlussier: not yet arrived at satisfactory answer, although i did see the patch in the bug
2015-04-16T15:15:48  <krvmga> kmlussier: we'll have to see on monday. we may just disable All Books if it's a problem

2015-04-16T15:15:57  <kmlussier> As far as removing the filter, I think it's a matter of going into your Coded Value Maps and removing All Books for the OPAC format group.
2015-04-16T15:16:05  <bbqben> @karma moving on
2015-04-16T15:16:05  <pinesol_green> bbqben: moving on has neutral karma.
2015-04-16T15:16:10  <bbqben> hah!
2015-04-16T15:16:18  <krvmga> kmlussier: yes, i was showing management here how i would do it
2015-04-16T15:16:26  <krvmga> it's easy
2015-04-16T15:16:27  <kmlussier> krvmga: Oh, ok. I thought that was your original question.
2015-04-16T15:16:35  <krvmga> well, as long as you know where to find it :)

2015-04-16T15:17:11  <krvmga> kmlussier: since i'm the public face of the opac around here, i would be hanged in effigy if not in reality
2015-04-16T15:18:12  <krvmga> i even get scowls from central site staff sometimes as though i'm truly the god of the opac and can do anything mwahahahahaha!
2015-04-16T15:18:16  <gmcharlt> krvmga: I'm quite sure you'll be fine - there's a workable patch available for testing that can be tested on Monday before you all go fully live
2015-04-16T15:18:36  <krvmga> gmcharlt: thanks.

2015-04-16T15:47:33  <Dyrcona> Though krvmga has left, I have loaded the branch in question on my development server and searches with formats don't seem slower than those without.
2015-04-16T15:48:46  <Dyrcona> IOW, it appears to have helped things.
2015-04-16T15:55:50  <kmlussier> Dyrcona++
2015-04-16T15:56:57  <kmlussier> If I had looked at the Ada Initiative site before the EOB meeting, I would have recommended a donation of $256 instead of $200.
2015-04-16T15:57:07  <Dyrcona> Hah!
2015-04-16T15:57:33  <Dyrcona> Donald Knuth used to pay that much for anyone who found "bugs" in his books, or maybe it was $2.56.
2015-04-16T15:57:43  <Dyrcona> No one every cashes the checks, they frame them.
2015-04-16T15:58:00  <Dyrcona> Gah. typos.
2015-04-16T15:58:06  * Dyrcona hangs his head in shame.
2015-04-16T15:58:13  <kmlussier> If it were $256, I would actively hunt down the bugs in his books.
2015-04-16T15:58:29  <kmlussier> Dyrcona: Will you pay me $256 if I find "bugs" in your IRC posts?
2015-04-16T15:58:42  <Dyrcona> No. :)
2015-04-16T16:00:31  <Dyrcona> It was bugs in tex, actually. I'm buggy today.
2015-04-16T16:09:58  <Dyrcona> And, it started at $2.56, 1 hexadecimal dollar.

2015-04-16T16:44:06  <eeevil> kmlussier: um...
2015-04-16T16:44:18  <dbs> (specifically around altering the logo)
2015-04-16T16:44:19  <kmlussier> eeevil: Are you worried?

2015-04-16T16:44:53  <gmcharlt> dbs: in due course; not actually at the top of my priority list just now
2015-04-16T16:44:59  <kmlussier> eeevil: I just need to know what your shipping address is if UPS is used. Looks like you typically use a PO Box?
2015-04-16T16:45:13  <eeevil> ah, I'll PM you
2015-04-16T16:45:19  <dbs> gmcharlt: fair enough, I'm only mentioning you specifically because I know the web page around the policy is somewhere on that list :)
2015-04-16T16:45:45  <gmcharlt> dbs: indeed; FWIW, I had noticed and was already planning to resond
2015-04-16T16:45:52  <gmcharlt> just not when I'm in rm -Rf * danger ;)
