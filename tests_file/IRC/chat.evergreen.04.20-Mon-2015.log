2015-04-20T14:31:07  <sylvar> Just a note (http://git.evergreen-ils.org/?p=SIPServer.git;a=blob;f=README) -- XML::Parser depends on libexpat (sudo apt-get install libexpat1-dev).
2015-04-20T14:31:40  <jeff> interesting. a hold from 2013 suddenly decided to pull a copy from another system.
2015-04-20T14:31:47  <sylvar> I trust someone can make that change with less overhead than me sending in a new public key for the git repo.
2015-04-20T14:33:47  *** sylvar has left #evergreen
2015-04-20T14:37:36  <jeff> XML::Parser is itself a dependency of XML::Simple
2015-04-20T14:39:52  <jeff> some irony about XML::Simple having a dependency chain of at least 20 other perl modules.
2015-04-20T14:47:51  * jeff sniffs around bug 1064651
2015-04-20T14:47:51  <pinesol_green> Launchpad bug 1064651 in Evergreen 2.3 "TPAC > Hold doesn't save selection_depth" (affected: 2, heat: 10) [Undecided,Fix released] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1064651
2015-04-20T14:50:07  <jeff> yup, that explains how the hold was created with selection_depth 0 to begin with.
2015-04-20T14:50:12  *** buzzy has joined #evergreen
2015-04-20T14:50:28  <jeff> and i wonder if the hold was unfillable in 2.5 as a result of the selection depth.

2015-04-20T15:22:50  <jeff> Yeah, it looks like these selection_depth = 0 hold requests were targeting zero copies on 2.5
2015-04-20T15:23:06  <jeff> (they were created on 2.1)
2015-04-20T15:23:45  <jeff> and now on 2.7 we see them successfully targeting (sometimes at locations outside of the hard boundary, since the 2.1-era bug meant that they were created with selection_depth = 0)

2015-04-20T16:24:18  <jeff> okay, looks like this particular hold has a somewhat special case in that it was targeting, but all copies were "on order" until just recently.
2015-04-20T16:24:38  <jeff> so the selection_depth of zero wasn't preventing it from targeting/capturing, as far as i can tell.
