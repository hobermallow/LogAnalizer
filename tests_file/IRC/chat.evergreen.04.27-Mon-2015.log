2015-04-27T11:34:06  <berick> maybe we can get some progress on that at egcon
2015-04-27T11:34:28  <csharp> I'll totally help with that if I can
2015-04-27T11:34:39  <berick> yes, you can help test
2015-04-27T11:34:43  <csharp> perfect
2015-04-27T11:34:53  <berick> IIRC, there's just a few fields remaining that have to be mapped.
2015-04-27T11:34:57  <berick> then it's testing time
2015-04-27T11:35:27  <csharp> awesome
2015-04-27T11:37:47  <csharp> so once the A/T thing is in place, it might be worth incorporating edi /openils stuff into the standard installation process

2015-04-27T13:40:20  <csharp> eeevil: I applied it to a test server and see far faster search times - I don't have an opinion about the implementation beyond that though
2015-04-27T13:40:52  <Dyrcona> eeevil: I loaded it on my dev system, which is 9.1 and apparently didn't need it, but I can say it caused no problems there.

2015-04-27T13:52:25  <kmlussier> eeevil: Is C/W MARS in production? If so, would it help if they added a comment to the LP bug reporting that it's working well for them?
2015-04-27T13:53:16  <eeevil> kmlussier: they're using it, and I think it would. I'm trying to avoid self-merging, but if that's what is needed to get it in, I will
2015-04-27T13:57:06  <Dyrcona> I'd sign off, but I didn't really need it.
2015-04-27T13:57:22  <Dyrcona> I'd be more comfortable if someone else did.
2015-04-27T14:04:54  <jboyer-isl> Dyrcona: It can provide benefits for 9.1 installations, it's just that only 1 of the code paths ever gets used. Your bib count determines whether your specific site would benefit or not. I don't particularly feel comfortable signing off on it either since I can't currently exercise the other code path.

2015-04-27T14:05:53  <Dyrcona> Well, I have no business signing off, since I obviously didn't look hard enough. :)
2015-04-27T14:22:48  <RoganH> I was just looking at our current search return numbers but they're even on our low powered test system orders of magnitude faster than csharp's.  I don't know if I'd find anything worth signing off on other than "this didn't screw up an existing system"
2015-04-27T14:28:40  <kmlussier> After talking to C/W MARS, I'm not comfortable signing off either. They aren't seeing the huge difference between limited searches and non-limited searches anymore. However, they are seeing slower overall search performance since their upgrade.
2015-04-27T14:28:45  <kmlussier>  Since the patch was applied as part of their upgrade, it's difficult for me to know if that change was partially caused by the patch or whether it was due to something else.

2015-04-27T14:39:50  <csharp> kmlussier: Terran was just testing here, and the challenge was trying to find search terms that weren't already cached by the live server - dunno if that's a factor there, but after a number of tries, Terran definitely sees the difference between pre- and post-fix
2015-04-27T14:42:57  <kmlussier> csharp: Yeah. I can definitely say that the format limiting problem was resolved. Their format-limited searches were timing out on their test system before their upgrade.
2015-04-27T14:43:39  <kmlussier> I just don't know if the other reported search slowness was a result of the patch, a result of the upgrade, or the result of something else. Too many moving parts.
2015-04-27T14:44:13  <csharp> kmlussier: well, the sure fire way to know is with an actual query from the postgres logs

2015-04-27T15:29:09  <mmorgan> Precat question: The precat's owning_lib is always the consortium (owner of call_number.id -1). I'm guessing there's no way to change that?
2015-04-27T15:30:16  <jboyer-isl> mmorgan: no, but the circ_lib is the location that created it.
2015-04-27T15:30:46  <jboyer-isl> Is this about reporting, or finding out what happened with some items?
2015-04-27T15:31:29  <mmorgan> Actually, it's circ policies.
2015-04-27T15:31:39  <jeff> the copy has a circ lib of the creating library, but it is attached to a call number that has an owning_lib of the top of tree. sometimes that can create challenges in terms of permissions.
2015-04-27T15:32:26  <jboyer-isl> Ah. That might be a pain then. I've not dealt with circ policies that looked at volumes for anything.
2015-04-27T15:34:12  * mmorgan started a bad precedent including owning_lib in circ policies way back when.
2015-04-27T15:35:05  <mmorgan> I guess this is a good reason to remove them.
2015-04-27T15:35:36  <csharp> gmcharlt++
2015-04-27T15:37:36  <Dyrcona> Well, you could move them to the circ_lib.
2015-04-27T15:37:52  <jboyer-isl> mmorgan: If no one there uses floating it may be as easy as just shifting from owning to circ and things will just work. Depends on how you're using them, of course.
2015-04-27T15:40:36  <mmorgan> circ_lib will work just as well for the rules, I'll just move them over.
2015-04-27T15:41:27  <tsbere> I seem to recall several parts of the system saying "use circ_lib instead of owning_lib for permission check when call number is -1", but I don't recall if rules do anything like that...
2015-04-27T15:43:31  <tsbere> Wouldn't be *hard*, persay. Precats should never have holds so only circ policies need adjusting. "If call_number ID = -1 use the circ lib as the owning lib" would probably be only a line or two in the DB func.
2015-04-27T15:44:01  <jeff> tsbere: may not matter for your current thinking, but precats are designed to be able to have copy-level holds now.
2015-04-27T15:44:43  <tsbere> jeff: Hmmmm. Ok, so double the number of additional DB func lines. :P
2015-04-27T15:46:13  <tsbere> Could take it further by defining "precat owning lib is at depth X for circ/hold rules" somewhere, then "fake in" the ancestor at that depth instead of the circ lib itself.
