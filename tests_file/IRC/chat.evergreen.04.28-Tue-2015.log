2015-04-28T12:11:27  <berick> curious if anyone else would be interested in a way to allow checkout of copies in certain statuses without the staff client warning dialog / need to override the checkout.
2015-04-28T12:12:13  <kmlussier> Like missing items?
2015-04-28T12:13:10  <berick> in spirit, yes, but there may be more layers invovled with missing items specifically I'm not thinking of though
2015-04-28T12:13:43  <kmlussier> berick: This might not be what you're thinking of, but ESI is doing this for us - http://masslnc.cwmars.org/node/2764#AL-03:_Library_Setting_for_Some_System_Alerts
2015-04-28T12:14:00  <kmlussier> But it's something that will be developed for the web client only.
2015-04-28T12:14:11  <csharp> berick: what's the use case prompting your question?
2015-04-28T12:14:44  *** BigRig_ has joined #evergreen
2015-04-28T12:15:09  <eeevil> kmlussier / berick: without more specific use cases, I think the alert suppression part of that linked stuff will impact what berick's talking about
2015-04-28T12:15:44  <eeevil> s/use cases/use cases I can't be sure, but/
2015-04-28T12:16:24  <berick> so we do this thing w/ new branches where we put the copy into a local, non-holdable copy status called "grand opening".  it's basically "dibs" for people who go to the branch.  once it's checked out once, it's just like any other copy.  the rub is the warning dialog and override requirement.
2015-04-28T12:18:58  <eeevil> ah ... that's not directly covered, but it could be a natural extension of the planned implementation
2015-04-28T12:20:57  <berick> eeevil: that's encouraging.  is there a bug entry for that yet?
2015-04-28T12:21:01  <berick> or specs
2015-04-28T12:21:01  <eeevil> berick: if your timeline allows, we can collab so as to avoid me painting your use case out, instead of having a separate, layered "ignore these situations" function
2015-04-28T12:21:34  * kmlussier mumbles something about responding to an email so that ESI can share specs on the project.
2015-04-28T12:21:35  <eeevil> no bug yet. tech specs are having some rough edges filed off, and then we'll bug it
2015-04-28T12:21:45  <eeevil> kmlussier++
2015-04-28T12:22:15  <berick> one question i need to ask internally is whether the requirement to override (even if it happens magically under the covers) is OK.  /me will look into that
2015-04-28T12:22:36  <berick> .. as I'm assuming that's what will happen based on kmlussier's docs
2015-04-28T12:22:53  <eeevil> berick: the main thematic difference is we're concerned with specific "from" statuses, and I could see you generalizing that part
2015-04-28T12:23:02  <berick> right
2015-04-28T12:23:42  <eeevil> and, yes, the override may still happen, and be magic.
2015-04-28T12:23:58  <eeevil> as in $method . ".override"
2015-04-28T12:24:29  <berick> ok, good, thanks for confirming
2015-04-28T12:29:42  <mmorgan> berick: we have a similar situation with an "On Display" status that some libraries use for new items. Not having to override there would be helpful
2015-04-28T12:29:59  <berick> mmorgan: good to know.  that sounds very similar, indeed
2015-04-28T12:32:11  * tsbere figured a temporary copy location would work better than a temporary status, if only for opac visbility purposes on Display items, but hasn't actually implemented his idea for temporary copy locations

2015-04-28T14:14:11  <csharp> trying to figure out if this is something we're doing wrong or if it's actually hard/impossible (related to Leslie St. John's General list email)...
2015-04-28T14:14:39  <csharp> we need vandelay to remove $ characters from the price fields when importing bibs
2015-04-28T14:15:50  <csharp> does the "Remove" field in Cataloging -> MARC Batch Import/Export -> Record Display Attributes do that?
2015-04-28T14:16:36  <csharp> if so, we currently have the value "$" in that field for "price" (020 or 022 $c)
2015-04-28T14:16:47  <csharp> and it's not removing the $
2015-04-28T14:17:05  <csharp> I thought it was worth asking before diving into the perl to see what's going on
2015-04-28T14:20:01  * csharp dives in and hopes for the best
2015-04-28T14:20:32  <jboyer-isl> csharp: If that will work, you'll likely have to use \$ because it looks like it's expecting regex syntax, where $ is special.
2015-04-28T14:22:21  <berick> csharp: record display attributes only affect display :(
2015-04-28T14:22:26  <csharp> it makes sense to me that it would be regexp syntax, and I'm told that was tried and didn't work, but I'll test it myself
2015-04-28T14:22:33  <csharp> berick: ah
2015-04-28T14:23:14  <csharp> hmm - so the acq code expects *no* dollar sign, but the file has them - is there a way to remove them within EG? or would that have to be done externally?
2015-04-28T14:23:41  <csharp> well, specifically, the DB rejects the '$' character as non-numeric
2015-04-28T14:23:58  <csharp> so I guess the acq code doesn't know or care
2015-04-28T14:24:27  <berick> code would have to be added to make that happen within ACQ
2015-04-28T14:27:01  * tsbere loves the vendor "But other <ils> customers have no issues" response - Half the time I get a list of those "other customers" I find they aren't using Evergreen.
2015-04-28T14:27:42  <berick> acq being what it is, there are a number of vendor-specific hacks in the acq code.  adding one to strip '$' from the price field does not seem crazy.
2015-04-28T14:28:00  <tsbere> Of course, then there are the vendors that say "But other <ils> customers have no issues" with <ils> *not* being Evergreen. At which point I get to say "That is all well and good. We are using Evergreen, not <other ils>" >_>
2015-04-28T14:28:05  <berick> or strip all non-numbers
