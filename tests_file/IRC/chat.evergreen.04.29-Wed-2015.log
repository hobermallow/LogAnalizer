2015-04-29T08:44:52  * csharp decides that asking libraries to use MarcEdit to remove the {dollar} characters manually is a pretty viable workaround until bug 1449724 is addressed
2015-04-29T08:44:52  <pinesol_green> Launchpad bug 1449724 in Evergreen "Acq Record Import Fails because of dollar sign in price field" (affected: 2, heat: 12) [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1449724
2015-04-29T08:45:42  * csharp wonders how other EG-using agencies ordering from Ingram handle the issue
2015-04-29T08:52:19  <kmlussier> csharp: I sent a question to my acq people but I haven't heard back.
2015-04-29T08:53:15  <kmlussier> I suspect we may just omit that subfield altogether. But I don't know for sure. I do know our libraries are not using MarcEdit before importing acq records.
2015-04-29T09:01:15  *** buzzy has joined #evergreen
2015-04-29T09:02:46  <mmorgan> csharp: I'm not directly involved in the acquisitions piece, but it's my impression that the $ has never been an issue for us, and many of our libraries have been importing Ingram records for some time.
2015-04-29T09:06:02  *** buzzy has quit IRC
2015-04-29T09:07:49  <csharp> kmlussier: that's interesting... if they omit the subfield, do you know how they estimate price?
2015-04-29T09:08:24  <kmlussier> csharp: They use a subfield in the holdings tag for price information.
2015-04-29T09:09:05  <csharp> kmlussier: well, the order records I'm looking at don't have holdings information... do you know if the order records they're using do?
2015-04-29T09:09:52  <kmlussier> Ah, I see now. Maybe it would be best if I send a response to the list, then. :) I just assumed you were using a holdings tag for other info.

2015-04-29T09:10:37  <kmlussier> We generally use the 962 field for holdings info here, but you can use anything.
2015-04-29T09:11:06  <csharp> pretty sure we use 952, but I don't remember off the top of my head - but that's with exports

2015-04-29T09:11:46  <csharp> hmm
2015-04-29T09:13:43  <csharp> so the 022 doesn't have a $c
2015-04-29T09:14:43  * csharp was just looking at the marc display attributes table where I believe our staff have been trying to fix this themselves (before berick clarified that those only affect display)
2015-04-29T09:15:00  <csharp> I don't know what's stock and what's custom :-/
2015-04-29T09:16:12  <csharp> it's the consequence of the fact that I'm really only involved with Acq when something's not working as expected - I usually have to backtrack over everything they've done without really knowing for sure what they've changed :-/
2015-04-29T09:18:31  *** ningalls_ has joined #evergreen
2015-04-29T09:19:14  <gmcharlt> csharp: in the line item attribute definitions, there's a "remove" column that lets you specify a regexp
2015-04-29T09:19:30  <gmcharlt> stuff that matches the regexp then gets removed when the acq MARC record is ingested

2015-04-29T09:28:56  <Dyrcona> csharp: When it comes to holding information in acq, it is all pretty much custom. :)
2015-04-29T09:29:28  <Dyrcona> That is, local configuration.
2015-04-29T09:29:45  * bshum thinks we don't use Ingram anymore for acq ordering in Evergreen. 
2015-04-29T09:30:06  <bshum> Mostly I hear about weird B&T stuff.
2015-04-29T09:30:29  <bshum> So either we don't use Ingram or it works really well... probably the first one.
2015-04-29T09:30:56  <kmlussier> We use Ingram a lot here. And we find it works pretty well.
2015-04-29T09:31:25  <bshum> I think how kmlussier described holdings subfield for cost is how we deal with it too.
2015-04-29T09:32:28  <kmlussier> By adding it to the holdings subfield, it automatically applies that price to the lineitem. I don't think that can happen if you're using the 020.
2015-04-29T09:36:58  <mmorgan> csharp: gmcharlt: FWIW, In acq.lineitem_marc_attr_definition we have, in the "remove" field for ISSN and ISBN and UPC this string:  (?:-|\s.+$)
2015-04-29T09:37:18  <mmorgan> We have that same "remove" string in every attr table associated with ISBN, ISSN, UPC.
2015-04-29T09:37:43  <csharp> gmcharlt: berick told me yesterday that's just for display - is that true?
2015-04-29T09:37:45  <gmcharlt> indeed - removing hyphens and anything after the first space
2015-04-29T09:38:25  <gmcharlt> "12345679X (pbk.)" ... you will not defeat us!!! ;)
2015-04-29T09:38:54  <kmlussier> csharp: I think that's a differnt thing. From what you said above, berick was referring to marc display attributes.
2015-04-29T09:38:59  <csharp> in that case $ signifies "end of line", right?
2015-04-29T09:39:08  <gmcharlt> csharp: yes
2015-04-29T09:39:09  <kmlussier> Or maybe it's the same thing.
2015-04-29T09:39:11  <csharp> ohh
2015-04-29T09:39:19  <csharp> lemme look there
2015-04-29T09:39:24  * kmlussier stops talking now because she is focusing on something else.
2015-04-29T09:39:26  <csharp> god - so many moving parts :-/
2015-04-29T09:42:26  <Dyrcona> csharp: It's what you asked for. :)
2015-04-29T09:42:45  <csharp> Dyrcona: :-)
2015-04-29T09:43:44  <csharp> argh - I wish I needed regexes more often so I would actually have to learn them :-/
2015-04-29T09:44:00  <Dyrcona> csharp: Which kind? :)
2015-04-29T09:44:25  <Dyrcona> jwz underestimated the number of problems. :)
2015-04-29T09:44:42  <Dyrcona> To match a $ in Perl, you'll want \$
2015-04-29T09:45:19  <Dyrcona> Otherwise, $ is treated as end of string.
2015-04-29T09:45:55  <csharp> okay, I'm tranlating (?:|\s.+$) to mean "match either "?:"  or "\s.+" until the end of the line ($)
2015-04-29T09:46:08  <csharp> but I don't know what ?: means here :-/
2015-04-29T09:46:26  <gmcharlt> csharp: try this - [^0-9.]
2015-04-29T09:46:43  <gmcharlt> i.e., moving anything that isn't a digit or a period
2015-04-29T09:46:46  <gmcharlt> *removing
2015-04-29T09:46:55  <csharp> gmcharlt: excellent - I'll try that
2015-04-29T09:46:58  <Dyrcona> csharp; No, "(?:" starts a non-capturing group.
2015-04-29T09:47:12  <csharp> Dyrcona: ah - thanks
2015-04-29T09:47:15  <csharp> that was throwing me
2015-04-29T09:47:25  <Dyrcona> csharp: It's like "(" but without back references.
2015-04-29T09:47:57  <Dyrcona> It's a smidge faster if you don't need \1, etc.
2015-04-29T09:48:07  <csharp> makes sense now
2015-04-29T09:48:38  <csharp> I was reading ? as "the preceding character is optional" but that didn't make sense when it was first
2015-04-29T09:48:40  <gmcharlt> (also, for the room - the relevant regexp_replace call in the extract_marc_field() stored function is invoking the replace with 'g' -- i.e., apply it to all matches)

2015-04-29T09:50:05  <Dyrcona> csharp: the original was (?:-|\s.+$) that means hyphen (-) or the first space (\s) followed by one or more of anything (.+) to the end of string ($).
2015-04-29T09:50:37  <csharp> okay, so | still means "or" there - makes sense
2015-04-29T09:51:00  <Dyrcona> Yep. The parens with ?: just make a non-capturing group out of it.

2015-04-29T10:16:08  <Dyrcona> You mean for acq? If so, no. I don't really have much of a way to test, since I don't actually have any vendor accounts.
2015-04-29T10:16:19  <csharp> nah, just in general
2015-04-29T10:16:35  <Dyrcona> In general, I have been running Evergreen on 14.04 with success for about a year.
2015-04-29T10:16:37  <csharp> I think I have the ruby problem solved for now
2015-04-29T10:16:41  <csharp> oh good to know
2015-04-29T10:16:47  <Dyrcona> yep. I saw that.
2015-04-29T10:17:02  <Dyrcona> I thought about faking an EDI transaction for testing.
2015-04-29T10:17:28  <Dyrcona> That is, setting up a bogus vendor with a canned order and response to send.
2015-04-29T10:17:36  <berick> we've deployed 2 ubuntu 14.04 servers to productoin.

2015-04-29T10:18:34  * csharp theoretically wants us to support CentOS/RHEL, but understands why it doesn't have traction
2015-04-29T10:19:25  <csharp> I have an aging OpenSRF branch that installed dependencies from EPEL and got it up and running on CentOS
2015-04-29T10:19:30  <csharp> 6, I think
2015-04-29T10:19:49  <csharp> but I didn't get as far as Evergreen
2015-04-29T10:22:21  <bshum> I think for front-end app servers, I'm not too nervous about Ubuntu 14.04.  But for backend utilities, I get a little anxious to test further.
2015-04-29T10:22:43  <bshum> Acq EDI stuff, sure, but also have to test things like print notice generation, other scripts.

2015-04-29T11:00:23  <jboyer-isl> Dyrcona: Without a place to track them, how will people know when there's more than 1? (unless they're all from the same place, I suppose)
2015-04-29T11:00:26  <kmlussier> Dyrcona: Well, the thing is, if you don't add the direct link to jobs, nobody remembers it is there and then don't think to post it to the Evergreen site.
2015-04-29T11:01:13  <Dyrcona> See, that's where my thinking was headed about the Jobs category.

2015-04-29T11:04:51  <Dyrcona> General rule of thumb, do an apache reload after autogen.
2015-04-29T11:04:51  <Bmagic> I dont understand why. Did autogen alter the apache config?
2015-04-29T11:05:20  <Bmagic> Dyrcona: good to know
2015-04-29T11:05:39  <Dyrcona> Nope. But, it alters data that is read by perl mods at startup.
2015-04-29T11:06:00  <Bmagic> and a reload reinitializes all of the perl stuff?
2015-04-29T11:06:23  <Dyrcona> A reload tells running Apache processes to finish the request that they are handling, then shut down.
2015-04-29T11:06:41  <Dyrcona> When the next request comes in, it should spawn a new Apache child.
2015-04-29T11:06:53  <Dyrcona> Thus rereading the data.
2015-04-29T11:07:19  <Dyrcona> A restart says, shut down immediately, I don't care what you're doing.
2015-04-29T11:07:33  <Bmagic> so, it really is a restart but with a graceful first. apache2 reload = apache2 graceful-stop && apache2 start   ?
2015-04-29T11:08:05  <Dyrcona> That's one way to think of it, but I've never looked at the code or scripts to see what is actually done.
2015-04-29T11:08:24  <Bmagic> thanks guys!
2015-04-29T11:08:27  <Dyrcona> yw
2015-04-29T11:08:45  <berick> with a reload, the master apache process is not restarted.  it stays alive to queue requests while the children (gracefully) die off and start back up
2015-04-29T11:09:18  <berick> in case anyone is curious

2015-04-29T17:19:50  <bshum> I'm going to have to get a test system going with 2.8 stock to see if it's a template issue in our systems, or if it's a 2.8 regression.
