2015-05-07T08:36:22  <Stompro> I'm looking forward to meeting people next week, hopefully everyone puts their IRC handle on their name tags :-)
2015-05-07T08:36:46  <kmlussier> Hello Stompro! I'm looking forward to meeting you in person too! :)
2015-05-07T08:48:21  <kmlussier> Hmmm...I just went to look at something on my job listing, and noticed that I can't see jobs on the job dashboard if I'm not logged in to evergreen-ils.org.
2015-05-07T08:48:29  <kmlussier> That doesn't seem to be particularly useful.
2015-05-07T08:49:23  <Dyrcona> Sure, it has been two days, time for another kernel update. :)

2015-05-07T08:57:28  <kmlussier> Looks like I put the wrong jobs link in the menu. So I guess I need to figure out what the correct link is.
2015-05-07T09:02:34  <kmlussier> Got it. Looks much better now
2015-05-07T09:06:56  <csharp> @who got the wrong job because of the wrong web link?
2015-05-07T09:06:56  <pinesol_green> pastebot got the wrong job because of the wrong web link.
2015-05-07T09:07:04  <csharp> that's probably true

2015-05-07T09:07:09  <Dyrcona> heh
2015-05-07T09:07:50  <Dyrcona> So, our server is using a lot of RAM right now, and when I sort the running processes by resident memory used, my #2 item is a open-ils.trigger drone.
2015-05-07T09:08:15  <csharp> oh yeah - hackfest quickie idea - fix pastebot's "reset the paste ID every time I restart" issue ;-)
2015-05-07T09:09:20  <Dyrcona> It is also #3 on cpu time sorting, right behind ejabberd and the OpenSRF router.
2015-05-07T09:10:45  <csharp> dbwells: would you be amenable to creating a branch with your quick fix to bug 1419172? or do you think it's too hacky?
2015-05-07T09:10:45  <pinesol_green> Launchpad bug 1419172 in Evergreen "extend_reporter.full_circ_count view unusably slow on large datasets" (affected: 1, heat: 6) [Undecided,New] https://launchpad.net/bugs/1419172

2015-05-07T09:20:05  <Dyrcona> And, we ran out of swap, so had to shut everything down anyway.
2015-05-07T09:20:13  <Dyrcona> Think I'll reboot the server while I'm at it.
2015-05-07T09:21:08  <Dyrcona> And, we just got the last three of our new servers yesterday, so only another week or two to put with this cranky, old box.

2015-05-07T09:21:18  <gmcharlt> csharp: dbwells: looks reasonable to me, and the query plan with the new version rather less convoluted

2015-05-07T09:42:29  <csharp> Dyrcona: I wonder if your problems will just go away with the new hardware - we've seen that happen
2015-05-07T09:42:48  <csharp> "that" being "problems were solved by changing hardware"
2015-05-07T09:43:22  <csharp> gmcharlt: awesome
2015-05-07T09:43:55  <Dyrcona> Yeah, the new servers will definitely help with the running out of memory.
2015-05-07T09:44:16  <Dyrcona> We're also doing something like a brick setup with the new servers to spread the load.
2015-05-07T09:44:49  <csharp> gmcharlt: and we've been using it very happily in production - some of our libraries were actually convinced something was wrong because reports were returning in seconds when they used to take hours
2015-05-07T09:44:57  <Dyrcona> In the mean time, I'm adding more swap via a file on the current server.

2015-05-07T09:47:01  <Dyrcona> Yep. We had been doing pretty well for about 3.5 years, then lately we've been running out of RAM.
2015-05-07T09:47:10  <Dyrcona> Just the past couple of months.
2015-05-07T09:47:55  <Dyrcona> I was actually watching as it happened this morning, which is a bit of a wonder in itself.

2015-05-07T10:14:44  <kmlussier> RoganH: I was looking at the jobs board this morning. Was your plan to have people submit the jobs themselves or to go through somebody like you?
2015-05-07T10:15:02  <kmlussier> I was just wondering if we need a link to the page where you submit a new job.
2015-05-07T10:19:09  <jwoodard> do we have any catalogers on?

2015-05-07T10:20:59  <RoganH> kmlussier: originally we said they would go through me so we would have some vetting but there have been so few I'd be fine with making into a form and we can look them over after they're posted

2015-05-07T10:22:22  <RoganH> kmlussier: oh, no, I'm horribly offended, you'll have to appease me with a beer in Oregon
2015-05-07T10:22:26  <jwoodard> Quick question do you know of any reason why an item will not appear when you search it by title and isbn
2015-05-07T10:22:35  <jwoodard> in the catalog
2015-05-07T10:22:52  <kmlussier> jwoodard: Are you doing a keyword search?
2015-05-07T10:23:01  <jwoodard> I checked over the MARC record and everything is right and the title will appear when i am typing it in the search box
2015-05-07T10:23:42  <jwoodard> kmlussier: yeah and the title appears as Im typing it but when I click on it no results are brough back
2015-05-07T10:24:24  <kmlussier> jwoodard: Are you doing the search through the staff client or through the public catalog? Also, are there any items attached to the record?
2015-05-07T10:30:03  <jwoodard> kmlussier: Through the staff client and there are items attached.
2015-05-07T10:30:37  <kmlussier> So you said you click on the autosuggest term. Did you say you're adding isbn to the search too?
2015-05-07T10:31:02  <kmlussier> If so, that could be the problem. IIRC, autosuggest will automatically change your search to a title search. But it's been a while since I used autosuggest.
2015-05-07T10:31:35  <bshum> Yes, it changes the search type
2015-05-07T10:31:45  <bshum> (which we hated, but anyways)
2015-05-07T10:33:17  <kmlussier> Yeah, I don't think we liked that either, but it's been so long since we've evaluated autosuggest, that I don't recall the wishlist items anymore.
2015-05-07T10:33:33  <kmlussier> Beyond the big wishlist item of getting it to work with screen readers.
2015-05-07T10:34:05  <kmlussier> Well, not really work with screen readers. Not break the ability to use screen readers in the catalog is a more accurate representation of the problem.
2015-05-07T10:39:23  <bshum> I thought autosuggest wasn't going to pop up for advanced search though (which is the default search for staff clients)
2015-05-07T10:39:37  <kmlussier> bshum: Yes, that's true
2015-05-07T10:39:48  <jwoodard> kmlussier: No the isbn search was separate. The only way we can find this item is by a barcode search.
2015-05-07T10:40:24  <bshum> jwoodard: What version of Evergreen are you working with?
2015-05-07T10:40:24  <kmlussier> jwoodard: It sounds like the record wasn't properly ingested.
2015-05-07T10:40:53  <jwoodard> 2.7.3
2015-05-07T10:41:09  <kmlussier> You might want to try editing the MARC record, saving it again, and then see if you can retrieve it.
2015-05-07T10:41:23  <bshum> Anything interesting about the record?  Like was it ever deleted at any point and then brought back?
2015-05-07T10:42:06  <jwoodard> I did that as well. I change the isbn. Replaced the title. Added the isbn13 and search by that.
2015-05-07T10:42:55  <jwoodard> bshum: The only thing I can think of is that it was an old record that was import over when we joined the a consortium. Other than that...
2015-05-07T10:43:14  <bshum> Hmm
2015-05-07T10:43:29  <bshum> Well, I always get wary of bibs that don't reingest and think of https://bugs.launchpad.net/evergreen/+bug/1091885
2015-05-07T10:43:29  <pinesol_green> Launchpad bug 1091885 in Evergreen "Reingest bib needs to deal with missing metabib.record_attr entries" (affected: 4, heat: 26) [Medium,Confirmed]
2015-05-07T10:43:58  <bshum> If you have database access, you can check to see if there are actually metabib attributes associated with the bib in question.
2015-05-07T10:44:23  * bshum is afraid he doesn't know which consortium jwoodard  belongs to :\
2015-05-07T10:44:45  <jwoodard> NTLC
2015-05-07T10:45:47  <kmlussier> Ah, I forgot about that bug.

2015-05-07T10:46:04  <jwoodard> NTLC aka North Texas Library Consortium in case everyone cannot read my mind or auto guess acronyms ;)
2015-05-07T10:46:39  <bshum> jwoodard: I've had some passing familiarity with NTLC ;)

2015-05-07T10:56:17  <bshum> jwoodard: So my recommendation is to mention the issue up your chain of support, and see if they can test your bib/item and see if there are problems with the reingest on that record.
2015-05-07T10:57:20  <bshum> Something like: SELECT COUNT(*) FROM biblio.record_entry WHERE deleted = FALSE AND id NOT IN (SELECT source FROM metabib.record_attr_vector_list);
2015-05-07T10:57:41  <bshum> Would tell you how many bibs (which are not deleted) do not have a proper corresponding metabib.record_attr_vector_list entry
2015-05-07T10:58:02  <bshum> I just ran that on our systems and came up with 13 bibs, which makes me a little sad.
2015-05-07T10:58:58  <csharp> yay! 0 in PINES
2015-05-07T10:59:19  * csharp fully expected to see more than 0
2015-05-07T10:59:22  <bshum> csharp: Amazing!

2015-05-07T11:00:13  <mmorgan> Hmm. 3 in NOBLE :-(
2015-05-07T11:01:39  <bshum> I guess I can update the bug with these slightly better targeting SQLs
2015-05-07T11:02:08  <bshum> SELECT bre.id FROM biblio.record_entry bre LEFT JOIN metabib.record_attr_vector_list mravl ON mravl.source = bre.id WHERE bre.deleted = FALSE AND bre.active = TRUE AND mravl.vlist IS NULL;
2015-05-07T11:02:15  <bshum> In case you wanted the exact bib IDs for those missing entries
2015-05-07T11:02:36  <mmorgan> bshum++
2015-05-07T11:03:06  <bshum> mmorgan: Yeah, if you follow rjackson_isl's steps in his comment on that bug for a post-2.6 system, you can repair those missing entries.
2015-05-07T11:03:22  <berick> csharp: have you done any additional testing on EDI since your last comments in bug #1342227 ?

2015-05-07T12:50:04  <jonadab> Is that normal?
2015-05-07T12:50:33  <Dyrcona> For certain definitions of normal, yes.
2015-05-07T12:50:47  <Dyrcona> Not always desirable.
2015-05-07T12:51:17  <jonadab> Is it possible autogen needs more than 1 second to send a request?
2015-05-07T12:53:15  <Dyrcona> Could be, but then you might have other problems.
2015-05-07T12:54:23  <jonadab> Hmm... I've confirmed that those messages get put in the log when I run autogen.sh
2015-05-07T12:54:40  <jwoodard> gsams: It worked! That number though...I was hoping it wouldn't be that high.
2015-05-07T12:54:48  <jonadab> Four lines, actually, and that's only the last one.

2015-05-07T12:55:47  <jeff> jonadab: have you verified your ejabberd config changes, and that ejabberd was restarted after reconfiguring?
2015-05-07T12:55:59  <jeff> jonadab: also, have you checked your ejabberd logs?
2015-05-07T12:56:29  <jonadab> jeff: ejabberd and memcached were restarted after configuring, but I'm not knowledgeable enough about ejabberd to be certain the configuration is entirely correct.
2015-05-07T12:56:33  <Dyrcona> jonadab: Well, you could change up the loglevel in opensrf_core.xml and restart services. That might give you more information about what is going on.
2015-05-07T12:56:39  <jonadab> Though I /thought/ I just followed the install instructions.
2015-05-07T12:58:10  <jonadab> Dyrcona: I guess just the opensrf log levels (not the router ones)?
2015-05-07T12:58:52  <Dyrcona> jonadab: Yeah, specifically opensrf.settings.
2015-05-07T12:59:02  <gsams> jwoodard: I had a bad feeling once I started reading the conversation that it would be.  There have always been a number of oddities with our records.
2015-05-07T12:59:05  <Dyrcona> Maybe set it to 4.
2015-05-07T12:59:34  <Dyrcona> On an unrelated note: Does anyone adjust the swappiness or vfs_cache_pressure on their Evergreen servers?
2015-05-07T13:00:11  <jonadab> Oh, that DOES give new messages.
2015-05-07T13:00:25  <Dyrcona> Are they useful?
2015-05-07T13:01:06  <jonadab> Hang on, I'm restarting all the services again...
2015-05-07T13:02:28  <jonadab> (I'd done start-all after restarting ejabberd and memcached, but I hadn't done stop-all first, so I am redoing with that to make sure everything is as it should be...)
2015-05-07T13:03:54  <Dyrcona> jonadab: There is a --restart-all, too, and you can stop, start, and restart individual services.
2015-05-07T13:04:06  <jonadab> Oh, --restart-all, good to know.
2015-05-07T13:04:26  <Dyrcona> For instance, to restart just opensrf.settings: osrf_control --localhost --service opensrf.settings --restart
2015-05-07T13:04:50  <jonadab> Yes, I'd run across --service and --restart in the documentation.
2015-05-07T13:05:04  <jonadab> Not sure how I missed --restart-all

2015-05-07T13:27:30  <Dyrcona> The log looks like everything is OK.
2015-05-07T13:27:51  <Dyrcona> But is autogen.sh still saying it can't talk to opensrf.settings?
2015-05-07T13:30:36  <Dyrcona> Because opensrf.settings is passing on a request and getting responses.
2015-05-07T13:31:06  <Dyrcona> This does reveal a connected session that is not properly closed, but that should not result in your symptoms.
2015-05-07T13:31:39  <Dyrcona> jonadab: Here's a question: is this a fresh install or an upgrade?
2015-05-07T13:43:04  <jonadab> Dyrcona: It's a fresh install.
2015-05-07T13:43:14  <jonadab> Haven't even put any data into the DB yet.

2015-05-07T14:06:08  <kmlussier> We previously hadn't done release notes before for point releases, but I've had people ask me about them before. I'm hoping it's something we can do for the rest of the 2.8 release cycle and maybe do for future Evegreen releases.

2015-05-07T14:18:22  <remingtron> maybe at the conference someone can update the wiki page with status of the assigned but not completed tasks on the 2.8 docs page
2015-05-07T14:18:40  <jonadab> Dyrcona: All I did to the DB was the step in the instructions that creates the schemata and stuff.  I haven't attempted to import any data to this install.
2015-05-07T14:19:00  <jonadab> Oh, meeting, sorry.
2015-05-07T14:19:12  <yboston> jonadab: no problem
2015-05-07T14:19:34  <yboston> remingtron: like add a small update with soem additonal information like "need screenshots", etc
2015-05-07T14:20:25  <remingtron> yboston: or just "in progress" or remove a person's name if they have to back out
2015-05-07T14:20:34  <yboston> OK
2015-05-07T14:20:41  <remingtron> or post whatever files they have that need review

2015-05-07T14:22:38  <jeff> jonadab: you missed changing one of your maxrate values to 500000 -- you still have 1000
2015-05-07T14:22:54  <Stompro> jonadab, The problem is in your ejabberd.cfg, your shaper maxrate needs to be increased.... dang, Jeff beat me.
2015-05-07T14:23:11  <yboston> anything else for this topic?
2015-05-07T14:23:42  <remingtron> not from me
2015-05-07T14:23:48  <yboston> OK

2015-05-07T14:29:34  <remingtron> me, remotely
2015-05-07T14:29:41  <Stompro> I'm planning on attending.
2015-05-07T14:29:50  <kbutler> me, also remotely
2015-05-07T14:30:25  <yboston> Stompro: FYI, I would love to have you join us, but we are probably in a seperate room from the dev hackfest
2015-05-07T14:31:10  <yboston> kbutler: that is too bad we won't see you at the conference, we can try to connect with you
2015-05-07T14:31:48  <kbutler> I wish I was going, too. Maybe next year.
2015-05-07T14:32:29  <yboston> In terms of planning for the DIG hackfest, remingtron, kmlussier, and I can help with pushing content into the repo. Josh can help with that too
2015-05-07T14:32:48  <yboston> I can work with newcomers and give them a short tutorial
2015-05-07T14:33:03  <kmlussier> I'll be there, but I'll also be going to the dev hackfest for part of the day.
2015-05-07T14:33:03  <yboston> the rest of us can look at the 2.8 features list
2015-05-07T14:33:16  <yboston> kmlussier: I expected that
2015-05-07T14:33:31  <yboston> kmlussier: my boss would prefer that I go to the dev one too :)
2015-05-07T14:33:40  <kmlussier> heh
2015-05-07T14:33:49  <yboston> any questions or comments about the hackfest?
2015-05-07T14:34:14  <remingtron> I guess DIG is a gateway group to being a dev
2015-05-07T14:34:14  <yboston> oops, I forgot that we can also work on web cleitn docs. For example, reviweing submitted docs
2015-05-07T14:34:24  <yboston> yes
2015-05-07T14:34:48  <yboston> kmlussier is following my plans to the letter
2015-05-07T14:35:33  <yboston> unbeknownst to her
2015-05-07T14:35:51  <yboston> anything else?
2015-05-07T14:36:58  <yboston> I need to exit the meeting early, if that is OK with everyone

2015-05-07T14:47:12  <pinesol_green> Dyrcona: The outlook is hazy, please ask again later.
2015-05-07T14:48:47  * Dyrcona wonders what eightball has against Billy Preston?
2015-05-07T14:50:28  <Stompro> remingtron, if I want to add old missing stuff to the 2.8_needs doc, do I need to figure out what version it was originally added or can I just put it in anywhere?
2015-05-07T14:59:31  <dbs> Dyrcona: Outlook is an unreliable delibry system
2015-05-07T14:59:47  <dbs> Some people would say "delivery" but not me
2015-05-07T15:00:03  <Dyrcona> dbs: No argument from me on that one.
2015-05-07T15:00:15  <Dyrcona> ;)
2015-05-07T15:00:26  <Dyrcona> And, then boom!
2015-05-07T15:03:30  <remingtron> Stompro: good question. The intention was that we would document all new features for a version before it is released, so I guess everything remaining after that is part of the same "old stuff" pile
2015-05-07T15:04:09  <remingtron> Stompro: the only place we've put random old stuff so far, though, is here: http://evergreen-ils.org/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=evergreen-docs:todo&#new_features_needing_documentation
2015-05-07T15:04:16  <remingtron> but I'm open to your suggestions
2015-05-07T15:06:26  <jonadab> Dyrcona: BTW, thanks for your help earlier.  It turned out jeff's idea was right, but I appreciate all the help I can get :-)
2015-05-07T15:09:31  <Stompro> remingtron, I'm just seeing that some of the "Local Administration" and "Server Administration" items are not documented in the official docs, but are not listed on the 2.8_needs doc, I'm guessing because they were released long long ago.  I can try to figure out when each feature was released to add it to that section, but I'm not sure it is worth the effort.  How about just a "Unknown Release" section?
2015-05-07T15:10:20  <remingtron> Stompro: yes, that sounds just fine. not important when it was first introduced
2015-05-07T15:38:59  <pastebot> "mrpeters" at 64.57.241.14 pasted "Trouble with Z39.50 after adding new config.metabib_field xpath" (34 lines) at http://paste.evergreen-ils.org/51
2015-05-07T15:39:13  <mrpeters> been racking my brain on this, and i'm still not sure what i've done wrong
2015-05-07T15:39:39  <pastebot> "mrpeters" at 64.57.241.14 pasted "SQL to insert new config.metabib_field entries" (18 lines) at http://paste.evergreen-ils.org/52
2015-05-07T15:41:26  <mrpeters> is there a step in the process that I've neglected that is causing new MARC records from being created?
2015-05-07T15:42:13  *** jihpringle has joined #evergreen
2015-05-07T15:42:32  <mrpeters> running the insert manually gives "ERROR:  Attempted to UPDATE MARCXML that is not well formed"
2015-05-07T15:43:20  <jboyer-isl> mrpeters: your xpath should start with //marc:datafield... not //marcxml:data... marcxml goes in the format field.
2015-05-07T15:43:40  <mrpeters> jboyer-isl: stupid emojis -- can you pastie that
2015-05-07T15:43:50  <Dyrcona> Yep. what jboyer-isl said.
2015-05-07T15:44:04  <Dyrcona> mrpeters: Turn emojis off in your client. :)
2015-05-07T15:44:06  * mrpeters notes the random magic spells page needs updating then :)
2015-05-07T15:44:32  <jboyer-isl> Ah, all you need to do is take the xml out of the xpath line, just slash-slash-marc-colon-data...
2015-05-07T15:44:44  <mrpeters> ok
2015-05-07T15:45:06  <jboyer-isl> the format field tells the parser that it needs marcxml, so you're good to go there.
2015-05-07T15:45:23  <mrpeters> right on, ok makes sense -- thats what i get for using old docs i guess :)
2015-05-07T15:47:12  <mrpeters> GLORIOUS!  Thanks!  jboyer-isl++ Dyrcona++
2015-05-07T15:47:15  <jboyer-isl> Since I'm still logged into the wiki on this machine I went ahead and fixed the page.
2015-05-07T15:47:22  <mrpeters> oh, thanks!  i was just about to do that
2015-05-07T15:47:55  <Stompro> buzzy, would it save much money to cancel the Wed 12:00 shuttle, only 3 people signed up (including me), I could wait until the 2:30pm shuttle.
2015-05-07T15:48:16  <Stompro> Whoops, meant tuesday 12:00 shuttle.
2015-05-07T15:49:32  <Stompro> Is there free WiFi at the Portland airport?
2015-05-07T15:52:22  <Stompro> remingtron, I added some items that don't seem to be documented to the end of the 2.8_needs doc.  Let me know if that looks ok to you.
2015-05-07T15:53:27  <remingtron> Stompro: thanks!

2015-05-07T21:34:51  <jonadab> I'm here for the moment, but this channel tends to function mostly in the daytime.
2015-05-07T21:35:07  <jonadab> Daytime in the Americas, specifically.
2015-05-07T21:36:29  <nuentoter> hello again jonadab, how are you?
2015-05-07T21:38:09  <jonadab> Getting sleepy.  (It's after 9pm here, and I'm a morning person.)
2015-05-07T21:38:58  <nuentoter> you helped me the other week, and I was able to install my the server properly
2015-05-07T21:39:39  <nuentoter> I wiped my HDD and went to do a fresh install of linux and server from my notes to ensure I can do it on my own and got stuck again lol
2015-05-07T21:42:17  <nuentoter> i believe its postgresql giving me problems when i am installing the prerequisits
2015-05-07T21:45:19  <nuentoter> i just have a quick question, can i install postqresql in its default location or in /openils or somewhere else?
2015-05-07T21:46:36  <jonadab> I've been installing postgres using apt
2015-05-07T21:46:45  <jonadab> Like, apt-get install postgresql
2015-05-07T21:48:03  <jonadab> I think the Makefile.install also has a target for installing postgres.
2015-05-07T21:51:14  <nuentoter> thats what i did, it installed postgreql 9.4 and the make command requests 9.3  now that i'm looking into it more
2015-05-07T21:53:49  <jonadab> Shouldn't 9.4 be substitutable for 9.3?
2015-05-07T21:54:13  * jonadab asks this naively, knowing next to nothing about Postgres versions.
2015-05-07T21:54:48  <nuentoter> i would have thought so but it seems like not
2015-05-07T21:55:02  <jonadab> Oh, I also remember at some point maybe installing a -contrib package related to Pg.
2015-05-07T21:55:34  <jonadab> Not sure how relevant that still is.  This was versions ago.
2015-05-07T22:01:11  <jeff> guess i should find something other than the patron editor to work on.
2015-05-07T22:02:05  <nuentoter> im talking with someone in the #debian channel helping me understand compiling a little bit better
2015-05-07T22:03:56  <jonadab> One of these days I'm gonna try seeing what aimake makes of Evergreen.
2015-05-07T22:04:06  * jeff looks through bugs
2015-05-07T22:04:45  <jeff> actually...
2015-05-07T22:05:24  * jeff steps back and looks at how we talk about contributing
2015-05-07T22:11:07  <jeff> reddit.com
2015-05-07T22:11:20  <jeff> or i could procrastinate, inthe wrong window.
