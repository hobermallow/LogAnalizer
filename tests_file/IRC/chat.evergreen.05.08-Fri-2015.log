2015-05-08T00:58:55  <bshum> @later tell nuentoter If you're encountering that issue with PG 9.4, I'm sure it's cause Debian Jessie support for Evergreen is incomplete presently. It'll be better during the next round of maintenance releases next month.
2015-05-08T00:58:55  <pinesol_green> bshum: The operation succeeded.

2015-05-08T10:32:01  <kmlussier> Ugh.
2015-05-08T10:32:53  <kmlussier> Well, we actually got a benefit from the hotel last year due to the unexpected construction. So maybe we can ask for something like that again. :)
2015-05-08T10:33:22  <kmlussier> And it looks like it will be outside this time, so maybe not so much noise.
2015-05-08T10:34:05  <bshum> Could be interesting though, walking from Gorge room to the other part and vice versa
2015-05-08T10:34:25  <bshum> Since the main room is separate building outside. I think.
2015-05-08T10:34:48  <bshum> We just have great timing :)

2015-05-08T13:22:15  <Bmagic> im getting a weird error when checking out some items. I have ruled permissions out. Does this log entry mean anything? No active transaction -- required for CREATE
2015-05-08T13:23:12  <tsbere> That....seems odd. Only for some items?
2015-05-08T13:23:22  <mmorgan> kmlussier: No, sadly. We fled when the ups ran out.
2015-05-08T13:23:42  <kmlussier> mmorgan: Ah. So you're working from home now?
2015-05-08T13:24:23  <mmorgan> Trying to.
2015-05-08T13:24:25  <Bmagic> tsbere: yeah, items from one location
2015-05-08T13:24:39  <tsbere> One copy location or one org unit?
2015-05-08T13:24:54  <tsbere> Or, I suppose, "one workstation" where others are fine?
2015-05-08T13:24:54  <Bmagic> I register my workstation at this location, grab a book from the database circ_lib is equal
2015-05-08T13:25:10  <Bmagic> fail
2015-05-08T13:26:17  <Dyrcona> Bmagic: Is this a report that you got from the library, or does it only happen for you when registered at the location?
2015-05-08T13:26:33  <Bmagic> I am able to replicate it
2015-05-08T13:27:19  <Bmagic> http://pastebin.com/hRYxN0qg
2015-05-08T13:27:46  <Bmagic> circ due data / close date overlap ?
2015-05-08T13:29:44  <tsbere> "No request was received in 6 seconds, exiting stateful session" - I assume your session is timing out, causing your cstoreeditor to no longer have a transaction, which is causing the error
2015-05-08T13:30:44  <Bmagic> what's with the timeout?
2015-05-08T13:31:08  * bshum has never seen a timeout for checkout. 
2015-05-08T13:31:15  <bshum> Checkin on the other hand...
2015-05-08T13:32:10  <tsbere> excessive overlapping closed dates?
2015-05-08T13:33:29  <Bmagic> hmmm, libarary hours? actor.org_unit_closed?
2015-05-08T13:33:35  <tsbere> Both?
2015-05-08T13:33:44  <Dyrcona> Bmagic: Is it taking over 6 seconds to process the transaction?
2015-05-08T13:33:56  <Dyrcona> The logs make it appear so.
